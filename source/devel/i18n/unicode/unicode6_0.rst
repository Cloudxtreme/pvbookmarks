Description
============

The Unicode 6.0 core specification includes information on scripts newly encoded
in Unicode 6.0, as well as many updates and clarifications to other sections of
the text.

The release of the core specification completes the definitive documentation of
the Unicode Standard, Version 6.0.

In Version 6.0, the standard grew by 2,088 characters. Over 1,000 of these
characters are symbols used for text exchange on mobile phones.

The Unicode Standard now also includes the recently created official symbol for
the Indian rupee. After computers and mobile phones update to Version 6.0, the
rupee sign will be available for use like the $ or € now.

In addition, this version adds many CJK Unified Ideographs in common use in
China, Taiwan, and Japan,as well as characters for African language support,
including extensions to the Tifinagh, Ethiopic,and Bamum scripts.

Three scripts are supported for the first time: Mandaic, Batak, and Brahmi.

In October of 2010, the other portions of Unicode 6.0 were released: the Unicode
Standard Annexes, code charts, and the Unicode Character Database.
This allowed vendors to update their implementations of Unicode 6.0 as quickly as possible.
