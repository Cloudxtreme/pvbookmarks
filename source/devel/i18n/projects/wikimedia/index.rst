Introduction
============


One of the conclusions of the strategic plan was that much of the future growth
of our projects will come what is called the "global south".

There are many challenges to overcome and opportunities to realise.

The Language Engineering team will deal with those technical issues that prevent
many languages from realising their full potential.

Many of the key people of translatewiki.net make up the Language Engineering team.
This means that the whole area of internationalisation and localisation will
continue to get the attention it needs.

Localisation of the user interface is the most important single factor for
improving the usability for an editing and reading community.

The localisation and internationalisation effort has brought many features to
MediaWiki like the support for plural in sentences and the grammatical gender
and LocalisationUpdate to ensure that the work of its localisers makes a difference.
