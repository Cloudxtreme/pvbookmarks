Introduction
============

The Transifex Client is a command line tool that enables you to easily manage
your translations within a project without the need of an elaborate UI system.

You can use the command-line client to easily create new resources, map locale
files to translations and synchronize your Transifex project with your local
files and vice versa.

Translators and localization managers can also use it to handle large volumes of
translation files easily and without much hassle.
