**The Transifex Client is also available for Windows**.

You can download the latest version from http://files.transifex.com/transifex-client/0.8/tx.exe.

This executable is standalone and does not need to be installed.

Make sure you use backslashes (‘\’) in the path instead of slashes (‘/’) in your
configuration file (.tx/config).

To use it, download the executable inside your project, open the cmd program that
comes bundled with Windows and give the command:

    cd \path\to\project\

Now you can use it from the command line as described in the rest of the
documentation. An example session is presented in the following image.
