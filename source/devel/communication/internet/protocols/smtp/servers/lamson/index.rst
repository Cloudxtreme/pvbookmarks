The Python SMTP Server
======================

We've all been there, mucking around in the sendmail m4 macros trying one more
time to get the damn mailing list to update for the new users.

Every time we say, "This sucks, I want to rewrite this stupid thing." Yet, when
we're done, we simply crawl back to our caves covered in our sendmail wounds.

Lamson's goal is to put an end to the hell that is "e-mail application development".

Rather than stay stuck in the 1970s, Lamson adopts modern web application
framework design and uses a proven scripting language (Python).
