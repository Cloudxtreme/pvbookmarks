Introduction
============

 
``Crossbar.io`` is a unified application router that enables application 
developers to create powerful systems from loosely coupled application components.

Application components can talk freely to each other, whether running locally 
or when distributed over different machines using the application messaging 
services provided by Crossbar.io.

``Crossbar.io`` messaging services are based on WAMP (Web Application Messaging Protocol), 
an open protocol which provides easy to use remote procedure calls and 
real-time event notifications
