Welcome to the official website of libnfc. On this site you will find information
concerning the open source library for Near Field Communication (NFC).

libnfc is the first free NFC SDK and Programmers API released under the
GNU Lesser General Public License. It provides complete transparency and
royalty-free use for everyone.

Since the RFID market is spoiled by proprietary hard and software we want to
contribute constructively by distributing a free library which can be used for
various RFID and NFC applications.

This website mainly focuses itself on researches and developers that want to
work with NFC hardware but don't want the pain of programming NFC software on a
very low level.

Furthermore, this library does not require any license fee or non-disclosure
agreement to be signed for. This list shows the current supported features.

We hope this moves the NFC development to a more open culture where discussions
about applications and techniques can be shared among the users.
