Swiffy converts Flash SWF files to HTML5, allowing you to reuse Flash content
on devices without a Flash player (such as iPhones and iPads). Swiffy can't yet
convert DoubleClick Studio creatives.

Swiffy currently supports a subset of SWF 8 and ActionScript 2.0, and the output
works in all Webkit browsers such as Chrome and Mobile Safari.
