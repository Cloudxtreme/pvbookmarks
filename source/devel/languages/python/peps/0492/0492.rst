Why "async" and "await" keywords
=================================

   :align: center


async/await is not a new concept in programming languages:

- C# has it since long time ago [5]_ ;
- proposal to add async/await in ECMAScript 7 [2]_ ; see also Traceur project [9] ;
- Facebook's Hack/HHVM [6] ;
- Google's Dart language [7] ;
- Scala [8] ;
- proposal to add async/await to C++ [10]_ ;
- and many other less popular languages.

This is a huge benefit, as some users already have experience with async/await, 
and because it makes working with many languages in one project easier 
(Python with ECMAScript 7 for instance).
