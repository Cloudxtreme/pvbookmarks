:pep`435` adds support for explicit enumerations in the Python standard
library. One valid criticism of the accepted design is that there are some
awkward compromises in the definition syntax, most notably the fact that
you have to choose between explicit identification of the enum values in
the class based syntax and the repetition of the class name and the use of
strings in the functional declaration API.
`Andrew Cooke's review of the accepted PEP
<http://www.acooke.org/cute/Pythonssad0.html>`__ provides a good overview of
that criticism.
