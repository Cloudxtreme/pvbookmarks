pep 0008 Style Guide for Python Code
====================================================

.. seealso::

   - http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/



This document gives coding conventions for the Python code comprising the
standard library in the main Python distribution.

Please see the companion informational PEP describing
`style guidelines for the C code`_ in the C implementation of Python.

This document was adapted from Guido's original Python Style Guide
essay[, with some additions from Barry's style guide.

Where there's conflict, Guido's style rules for the purposes of this PEP.

This PEP may still be incomplete (in fact, it may never be finished <wink>).
