Abstract
========

This PEP specifies a tagging system to indicate with which versions of Python 
a built or binary distribution is compatible. 

A set of three tags indicate which Python implementation and language version, 
ABI, and platform a built distribution requires. 

The tags are terse because they will be included in filenames.
