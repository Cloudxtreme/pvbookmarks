The aim of this PEP is to standardize the high-level structure of docstrings: 
what they should contain, and how to say it (without touching on any markup syntax 
within docstrings). 

The PEP contains conventions, not laws or syntax::

    "A universal convention supplies all of maintainability, clarity, consistency, 
    and a foundation for good programming habits too. 
    
    What it doesn't do is insist that you follow it against your will. That's Python!"
