Welcome! Python-on-a-Chip (p14p) is a project to develop a reduced Python 
virtual machine (codenamed PyMite) that runs a significant subset of the Python 
language on microcontrollers without an OS. 

The other parts of p14p are the device drivers, high-level libraries and other 
tools. Please join the python-on-a-chip google group to discuss this project.
