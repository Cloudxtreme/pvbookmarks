Release Notes
=============

.. seealso:: http://ironpython.codeplex.com/releases/view/74478


On behalf of the IronPython team, I'm happy to announce the final release
IronPython 2.7.2.

This release includes everything from IronPython 2.7 and 2.7.1 as well.

Like all IronPython 2.7-series releases, .NET 4 is required to install it.
Installing this release will replace any existing IronPython 2.7-series installation.

Unlike previous releases, the assemblies for all supported platforms are
included in the installer as well as the zip package, in the "Platforms" directory.

IronPython 2.7.2 includes support for .NET 3.5, .NET 4, Silverlight 4, and
Silverlight 5, and preliminary releases for Mono for Android 4.0 and
Windows Phone 7.5.

For 2.7.2, the mobile platforms are previews; they have known issues, and expect
them to change for 2.7.3.

The biggest improvements in IronPython 2.7.2 are:

- support for loading libraries from zip archives (the zipimport module);
- the sqlite3 module;
- many improvements to the pyc.py compiler, such as the ability generate
  standalone executables by embedding the IronPython assemblies;
  and numerous other bug fixes.
