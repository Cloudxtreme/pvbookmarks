About
=====

IronPython is an implementation of the Python programming language running
under .NET/Mono and Silverlight/Moonlight.

- It supports an interactive console with fully dynamic compilation.
- It's well integrated with the rest of the .NET Framework and makes all .NET
  libraries easily available to Python programmers, while maintaining
  compatibility with the Python language.
- There also is Visual Studio tooling integration.

IronPython is an open source project freely available under the Apache License
v2.0. The sources are stored on GitHub as part of the IronLanguages project.
