	Subject: [Python-Dev] New committers coming online

As agreed to at the language summit, I have pinged the IronPython,
Jython and PyPy teams for committers on their respective teams who
(do/did not) have commit rights prior to PyCon. These people are:

- Jeff Hardy (IronPython)
- Alex Gaynor (PyPy)
- Carl Friedrich Bolz (PyPy)
- Maciej Fijalkowski (PyPy)
- Antonio Cuni (PyPy)

And one other whose CLA I have in my bag (still haven't unpacked from
PyCon). So if you see them committing, this is a heads up.

**A side note: The Jython guys would really love to join us in our HG
future-land. Frank Wierzbicki expressed a lot of interest in this**.
