Hi all,

As I'm sure you're all aware, the PyCon sprints are going on right now and will
run for two more days. As a result, you may have noticed an increased number of
patches over the last few days -- many of these were from first-time contributors.

The turnout for the CPython sprint has been huge and I wanted to introduce and
thank a number of people for coming out.

- Scott Wilson
- Denver Coneybeare
- Jeff Ramnani
- Alicia Arlen
- Michael Henry
- Natalia Bidart
- Matias Bordese
- Robbie Clemons
- Evan Dandrea
- Jonathan Hartley
- Piotr Kaspyrzyk
- Brandon Craig Rhodes


There were a few others from which I didn't get their name, but thanks to everyone
for your contributions!


http://wiki.python.org/moin/Pycon2011Sprint has a listing of what the new
contributors have been working on, including the issues that have been submitted.


Additionally, I did a small write-up (with a picture!) of what everyone has
been up to: http://blog.briancurtin.com/2011/03/16/pycon-2011-cpython-sprint-newcomers/
