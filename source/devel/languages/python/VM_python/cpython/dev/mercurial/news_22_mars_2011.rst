I don't have push rights so I can not push anything to <http://hg.python.org/>.
However, I tried to click the "server side clone", and to my surprise, it
worked. I was expecting that some verification would be made, but there is now
a new feature branch at: <http://hg.python.org/features/pep-380/>.
Sorry to have done that, once again, I was not expecting to actually have the
rights to cause any side-effect on <http://hg.python.org/>. I guess that it may
not be desirable to allow anyone do such server-side clone.

Anyway, I can not push to this feature branch, so for now it's just a clone of
the curent tip.

Done here:
<https://bitbucket.org/rndblnch/cpython-pep380/>

The pep-380 changeset is pushed on top of current tip and is visible here:
