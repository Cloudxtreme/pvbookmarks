This Python library was evolved at IronPort Systems and has been provided as
open source by Cisco Systems under an MIT license.

Shrapnel is a library for high-performance concurrency.

It uses coroutines to implement user threads on top of either kqueue (FreeBSD, OS X)
or /dev/epoll (linux), and is written mostly in Pyrex/Cython, supporting both
32-bit and 64-bit platforms.

It is the culmination of about 8 years of work at IronPort Systems, a provider
of high-speed mail appliances.

It was open-sourced by Cisco Systems in late 2011.
