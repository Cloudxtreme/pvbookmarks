The cli package is a framework for making simple, correct command line
applications in Python.

With cli, you can quickly add standard command line

- parsing;
- logging;
- unit and functional testing;
- and profiling to your CLI apps.

To make it easier to do the right thing, cli wraps all of these tools into
a single, consistent application interface
