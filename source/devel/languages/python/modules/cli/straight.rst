About
======

I'd like to announce a new project, based on straight.plugin, a command 
framework that provides a declarative way to define command-line options, 
sub-commands, and allows plugins from third-parties to expand commands.


This is all very early, I'm calling this version 0.1a1 and lots of things 
are missing, but here is an example (which works) of a small todo application 
built with this.
