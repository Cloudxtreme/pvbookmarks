Introduction
============

SimpleCV is an interface for Open Source machine vision libraries in Python.
It provides a consise, readable interface for cameras, image manipulation,
feature extraction, and format conversion.

Our mission is to give casual users a comprehensive interface for basic machine
vision functions and an elegant programming interface for advanced users.

This talk is a brief summary of Computer Vision tutorial we proposed for 
PyCon 2013. 

In this talk we will discuss what computer vision is, why it's useful, 
what tools exist in the Python ecosystem, and how to apply it to your 
project. 

The talk will focus on the SimpleCV library but also touch upon NumPy, 
SciPy and iPython notebooks.
