bitstring is a pure Python module that makes the creation, manipulation and
analysis of binary data as simple and natural as possible.

Bitstrings can be constructed from integers, floats, hex, octal, binary, bytes
or files. They can also be created and interpreted using flexible format strings.

Bitstrings can be sliced, joined, reversed, inserted into, overwritten, etc.
with simple methods or using slice notation. They can also be read from,
searched and replaced, and navigated in, similar to a file or stream.

Internally the bit data is efficiently stored in byte arrays, the module has
been optimized for speed, and excellent code coverage is given by over 400 unit
tests.

The latest versions are available for Python 2.6 and later (including Python 3).

For Python 2.4 / 2.5 you can still use version 1.0, but you should refer to the
manual that comes with the bitstring 1.0 download as some of the information on
this website isn't applicable to that version.
