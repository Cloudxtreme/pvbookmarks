EasyGUI is a module for very simple, very easy GUI programming in Python.

Experienced Pythonistas need to be able to make simple GUI interfaces quickly
and easily.

New Python programmers, students, and sysadmins need GUI capabilities that don't
require knowledge of Tkinter, frames, widgets, callbacks or lambda.

This is what EasyGUI provides. Using EasyGUI, all GUI interactions are invoked
by simple function calls.

EasyGUI is different from other GUIs in that EasyGUI is NOT event-driven.

It allows you to program in a traditional linear fashion, and to put up dialogs
for simple input and output when you need to. If you have not yet learned
the event-driven paradigm for GUI programming, EasyGUI will allow you to be
productive with very basic tasks immediately.

Later, if you wish to make the transition to an event-driven GUI paradigm, you
can do so with a more powerful GUI package such as anygui, PythonCard, Tkinter,
wxPython, etc.
