Introduction
============

Kivy - Open source Python library for rapid development of applications
that make use of innovative user interfaces, such as multi-touch apps.

Kivy is running on Linux, Windows, MacOSX, Android and IOS. 

You can run the same code on all supported platforms.

It can use natively most inputs protocols and devices like WM_Touch, 
WM_Pen, Mac OS X Trackpad and Magic Mouse, Mtdev, Linux Kernel HID, TUIO. 

A multi-touch mouse simulator is included. 


Business Friendly
==================

Kivy is 100% free to use, under LGPL 3 licence. 

The toolkit is professionally developed, backed and used. You can use it 
in a product and sell your product.

The framework is stable and has a documented API, plus a programming 
guide to help for in the first step.


Why bother ?
============

Why would you want to use Kivy? After all, there are many great toolkits
(or frameworks, or platforms) available out there – for free.

You have Qt and Flash, to name just two good choices for application development,
and many of these numerous solutions already support Multi-Touch.

So what is it that makes Kivy special and worth using ?

Focused
=======

Kivy is focused. You can write a simple application with a few lines of code.

Kivy programs are created using the Python programming language, which is
incredibly versatile, powerful yet easy to use.

**In addition, we created our own description language, the Kivy Language, for
creating sophisticated user interfaces.**

This language allows you to set up, connect and arrange your application
elements quickly.

We feel that allowing you to focus on the essence of your application is more
important than forcing you to fiddle with compiler settings.

We took that burden off your shoulders.


Funded
======

Kivy is actively developed by professionals in their field. Kivy is a
community-influenced, professionally developed and commercially backed solution.

Some of our core developers develop Kivy for a living. Kivy is here to stay.
It’s not a small, vanishing student project.
