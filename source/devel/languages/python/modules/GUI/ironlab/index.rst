Introduction
============

IronLab is suite of WPF controls providing an embeddable, interactive numerical
computing environment for scientific, engineering and mathematical use.


Requirements
============

IronLab runs on .NET 4.0. Some features (e.g. thick 3D lines) require the
DirectX End-User Runtime.

IronLab is only tested against Windows 7, although has been run successfully
on other systems.

IronLab is built using Visual Studio 2010.

There is a released set of binaries, although the recommendation is to obtain
the latest version from SVN.

Concerning the released zip files, IronPlot includes only the IronPython
plotting component that can be unzipped and copied into the IronPython
site-packages folder.

IronLab includes IronPlot, the IronPythonConsole and is packaged with NumPy.

The idea is to give a demonstration of how a complete embeddable console can
be assembled from the components.
