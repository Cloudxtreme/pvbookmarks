Introduction
============


Scapy is a packet manipulation tool for computer networks, written in Python 
by Philippe Biondi. It can forge or decode packets, send them on the wire, 
capture them, and match requests and replies. It can also handle tasks like 
scanning, tracerouting, probing, unit tests, attacks, and network discovery.

Scapy provides a Python interface into libpcap, (WinPCap on Windows), in a 
similary way to that in which Wireshark provides a view and capture GUI. 
It can interface with a number of other programs to provide visualisation 
including Wireshark for decoding packets, GnuPlot for providing graphs, 
graphviz or VPython for visualisation, etc.
