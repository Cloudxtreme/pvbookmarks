library with cross-python path, ini-parsing, io, code, log facilities.

This document is an attempt to briefly state the actual specification of the
py.log module. It was written by Francois Pinard and also contains some ideas
for enhancing the py.log facilities.

NOTE that py.log is subject to refactorings, it may change with the next release.

This document is meant to trigger or facilitate discussions. It shamelessly
steals from the Agile Testing comments, and from other sources as well, without
really trying to sort them out.
