Crate is a PyPI Mirror/Python Package Index that was written to make it easy to
discover packages, evaluate them for usefulness, and then install them.

Additionally it also focuses on presenting an extremely stable interface to PyPI
compatible applications (e.g. pip).

With Crate you should be able to quickly find, evaluate, and install your
packages with no worries about if something is going to be down or not.
