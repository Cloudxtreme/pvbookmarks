Mozilla is now officially listed as a `Pycon US sponsor`_.

This is great news for Python and for the Mozilla Community: more and more
projects in Mozilla are using Python. It’s the mainstream language for all
the work we’re doing in the `Services team on server-side`_, and numerous
projects like `SUMO`_ or `AMO`_ are powered by Python.

So, if you are involved in the Mozilla community and in Python, you should
consider submitting a talk or a tutorial. Or just attend to the conference
in Santa Clara next March.
