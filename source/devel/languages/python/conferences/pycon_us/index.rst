**PyCon** is the largest annual gathering for the community using and developing
the open-source Python programming language.

registration far cheaper than most comparable technology conferences, to keep
PyCon accessible to the widest group possible.

**PyCon** is a diverse conference dedicated to providing an enjoyable
experience to everyone. Our code of conduct is intended to help everyone
maintain the PyCon spirit. We thank all attendees and staff for observing it.
