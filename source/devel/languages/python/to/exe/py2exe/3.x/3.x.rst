Description
===========


This chapter briefly explains how to create a Windows extension module for
Python using Microsoft Visual C++, and follows with more detailed background
information on how it works.  The explanatory material is useful for both the
Windows programmer learning to build Python extensions and the Unix programmer
interested in producing software which can be successfully built on both Unix
and Windows.

Module authors are encouraged to use the distutils approach for building
extension modules, instead of the one described in this section. You will still
need the C compiler that was used to build Python; typically Microsoft Visual
C++.
