PyScripter is a free and open-source Python Integrated Development Environment
(IDE) created with the ambition to become competitive in functionality with
commercial Windows-based IDEs available for other languages.

Being built in a compiled language is rather snappier than some of the other
Python IDEs and provides an extensive blend of features that make it a
productive Python development environment
