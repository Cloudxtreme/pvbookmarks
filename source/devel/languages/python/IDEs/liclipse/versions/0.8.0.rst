LiClipse 0.8.0 is now available for download
============================================

The release highlights for this release are:

- Spell-checking has been added. By default matches all partitions that map to 
  the string color. 
  
  See: http://brainwy.github.io/liclipse/spell_checking.html for details on how 
  to customize to custom scopes for a language.

- Adding a new language file (or editing an existing one) properly refreshes all 
  information related to a language (so, just reopening an editor is enough to 
  get all changes so that restarting LiClipse should never be needed when 
  creating/editing language files).

- Context menu on the editor > languages besides providing a way to change the 
  language for the current editor also provides an easy way to create a new 
  language file.

- It's possible to add new directories which contain language files.

- Made some fixes in the CSS editor.

- Fixed parser to be less greedy on whitespaces so that the MatchLineStartRule 
  matches properly.

Cheers,

Fabio
