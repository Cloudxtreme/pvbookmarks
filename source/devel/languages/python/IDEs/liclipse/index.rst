Who is planning this ?
=======================

First let me introduce myself: I'm Fabio Zadrozny, and I've been developing 
PyDev (http://pydev.org) for a long time (10 years and counting).

During that time, I maintained PyDev in many different situations: first 
I did it only in my spare time and later it was backed by Aptana and 
afterwards by Appcelerator. Some months ago, Appcelerator decided to 
stop supporting it, so, I'm asking the community to help me in the 
endeavor of continuing the project.

As a note for those that don't know PyDev: it's a plugin to edit Python 
inside of Eclipse and it's among the best environments available for that 
purpose (in 2011, it was a technology winner in the Eclipse community awards).

    
 
What are the targets of the project ?
======================================

Besides making sure that PyDev keeps evolving (while remaining open source 
and well supported), I want to improve the Eclipse UI and provide a 
toolchain which will provide at least basic support for many languages 
out there (which is named LiClipse: a short for "Lightweight Eclipse").

Still, note that most of the work in the proposal is geared towards 
PyDev itself (and even more so based on the number of people that 
contribute to the PyDev Knight perk -- see details below).
