In Python 3.2 a new feature was added for concurrent programming - futures. 

In Python 3.3 generators have been extended to allow returning from a 
generator with a value. 

In this talk we'll show how these features can be combined to create a 
rich and easy to use asynchronous programming model which can be used 
for creating highly responsive GUI applications or easy async programming.
