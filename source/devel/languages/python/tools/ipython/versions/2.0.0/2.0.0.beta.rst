Hi all,

We are excited to announce the first beta release of IPython 2.0.0. 

We would very much appreciate your help ironing it out before the final
release in a few weeks. 

We still have a few bugs and lots of documentation we plan to get to before 
release, but it should be feature complete.

Give it a try: http://archive.ipython.org/testing/2.0.0/

A quick summary of `changes <http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/2/whatsnew/development.html>`_

Major new features:

- New modal UI in the notebook (check out the UI Tour in the Help Menu)
- New Interactive Widgets (you can check out the
  `tutorial <http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/ipython/ipython/blob/master/examples/widgets/index.ipynb>`_
  on nbviewer, but they really have to be tested interactively to see how
  cool they are.
- Filesystem navigation from the dashboard (no more uuid urls)
- single Python 2 / Python 3 codebase (no more 2to3)
- Some notebook security. 
  We will post a more detailed writeup of this one soon.

This is the first release of IPython to try the wheel binary format, which
is a much smaller download and faster to install, so if you have any issues
with the wheel, do let us know.
