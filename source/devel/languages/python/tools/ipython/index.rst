One of Python's most useful features is its interactive interpreter.
It allows for very fast testing of ideas without the overhead of
creating test files as is typical in most programming languages.
However, the interpreter supplied with the standard Python distribution
is somewhat limited for extended interactive use.

The goal of IPython is to create a comprehensive environment for
interactive and exploratory computing.  To support this goal, IPython
has three main components:

* An enhanced interactive Python shell.
* A decoupled two-process communication model, which
  allows for multiple clients to connect to a computation kernel, most notably
  the web-based notebook
* An architecture for interactive parallel computing.

All of IPython is open source (released under the revised BSD license).
