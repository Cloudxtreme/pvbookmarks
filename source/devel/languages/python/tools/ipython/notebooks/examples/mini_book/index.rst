Introduction
=============

This repository contains all code examples from the book [Learning IPython for 
Interactive Computing and Data Visualization](http://www.packtpub.com/learning-ipython-for-interactive-computing-and-data-visualization/book), 
[Packt Publishing](http://www.packtpub.com), by [Cyrille Rossant](http://cyrille.rossant.net).


Book overview
-------------

This book is a **beginner-level introduction to IPython** for *interactive 
Python programming*, *high-performance numerical computing*, and *data visualization*. 

It assumes nothing more than familiarity with Python. 

It targets developers, students, teachers, hobbyists who know Python a bit, and 
who want to learn IPython for the extended console, the Notebook, and for more 
advanced scientific applications.

The book first introduces IPython for interactive Python and shell programming. 

It shows how IPython can considerably improve the productivity of a developer 
who creates, debugs, benchmarks and profiles Python code.

Then, the reader learns the very basics of vector computing, and discovers how 
to load and analyze numerical and tabular data with NumPy and Pandas. 

The book shows the interactive visualization capabilities of the platform with 
Matplotlib, SciPy and PIL. It also contains a few image processing examples.

Some techniques to accelerate Python code are also demonstrated, using either 
interactive parallel computing features from IPython (using MPI or not), or 
Cython to compile a portion of the code in C for really interesting speedups.

Finally, the book shows how IPython can be customized for advanced uses, notably 
with the creation of new extensions and magic commands.


Code examples
-------------

Most files are IPython notebooks (`.ipynb` extension with JSON data). 

There are also some Python external scripts (`.py` extension).

The following modules are used in at least one example:

  * Python 2.7
  * IPython 0.13+
  * NumPy
  * Pandas
  * SciPy
  * Matplotlib
  * Matplotlib basemap
  * NetworkX
  * PyQt or PySide
  * Cython
  * PIL
