Description
===========

QuTiP is an open-source python framework for simulating the dynamics of quantum 
systems. 

QuTiP is based on the excellent Numpy and Scipy numerical packages, and graphical 
output is provided by Matplotlib. 

QuTiP aims to provide user-friendly and efficient numerical simulations of a 
wide variety of quantum mechanical problems commonly found in physics 
applications in fields such as quantum optics, trapped ions, superconducting 
circuits, and quantum nanomechanical resonators.
