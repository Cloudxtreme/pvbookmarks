This short primer on Python is designed to provide a rapid "on-ramp" to enable 
computer programmers who are already familiar with concepts and constructs in 
other programming languages learn enough about Python to facilitate the 
effective use of open-source and proprietary Python-based machine learning 
and data science tools.

Using an IPython Notebook as a delivery vehicle for this primer was motivated 
by Brian Granger's inspiring tutorial_, The IPython Notebook: Get Close to Your 
Data with Python and JavaScript, one of the highlights from my `Strata 2014`_
conference experience.
