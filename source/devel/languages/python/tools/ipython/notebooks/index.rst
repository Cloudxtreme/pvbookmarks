Introduction
=============

The ``notebook`` extends the console-based approach to interactive computing in
a **qualitatively new direction**, providing a web-based application suitable for
capturing the whole computation process: developing, documenting, and
executing code, as well as communicating the results.  The IPython notebook
combines two components:

**A web application**: a browser-based tool for interactive authoring of
documents which combine explanatory text, mathematics, computations and their
rich media output.

**Notebook documents**: a representation of all content visible in the web
application, including inputs and outputs of the computations, explanatory
text, mathematics, images, and rich media representations of objects.
