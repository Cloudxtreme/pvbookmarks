This year my contribution to the AGU fall meeting 2013 was all about the 
development of Open Source Software to enable the reproducibility of scientific 
products, with both a Poster and an Oral presentation. 

The AGU was the perfect opportunity to share my ideas on a topic that is one 
of my main interests.

This was my 2nd time at AGU, but my first time with an oral presentation which 
turned in a real challenge!

The main issue was a combination of 2 factors : I had decided to generate the 
slideshow in realtime as HTML from an online IPython Notebook. 

I thought it would be cool to show this functionality, as well as the work 
itself. Unfortunately, I was dependent on an internet connection at the time 
of the presentation, but alas, at AGU the presenter computer doesn’t have 
internet connection! Definitely not the best conditions for a web based 
slideshow generated “on-the-fly” by the execution of an IPython Notebook.
