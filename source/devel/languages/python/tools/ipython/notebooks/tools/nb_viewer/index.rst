What is nbviewer ?
===================

IPython Notebook Viewer (or nbviewer in short) is a free webservice that allows 
you to see static html versions of hosted notebook files. 

As long as a notebook is publicly available, by giving its url to nbviewer you 
should be able to view it.

You can also directly browse collections of notebooks through github 
repositories directly on nbviewer
