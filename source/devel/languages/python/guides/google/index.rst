The `SoC framework`_, and Melange web applications built upon it, are implemented
in Python (it is one of the programming language besides Java and Go which are
currently supported by Google App Engine).

This style guide is a list of dos and don'ts for Python contributions to the
Melange project.

The rules below are not guidelines or recommendations, but strict rules.

You may not disregard the rules we list below except as approved on a
need-to-use basis.

But note also the advice on consistency at the end of the guide.
