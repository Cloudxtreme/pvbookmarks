Introduction
============


In this article I’m going to try to lay out a workable way to develop Python 
applications (primarily Web applications) using Docker. 

Although I’m focusing on Python using the Flask micro-framework, the intent is 
to show how Docker can be used to provide a better way of developing and sharing 
applications (written in any language or framework) by encapsulating dependencies 
and dramatically reducing the gap between development and production.
