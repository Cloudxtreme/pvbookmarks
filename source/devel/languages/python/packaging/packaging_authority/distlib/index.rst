Introduction
============


Welcome to the documentation for ``distlib``, a low-level library of packaging 
functionality which is intended to be used as the basis for third-party packaging 
tools. 

Using a common low-level layer will improve interoperability and consistency of 
user experience across those tools which use the library.


Dislib versus Setuptools
=========================

::

    distlib is a core packaging library, that is focused on newer PEPs.
    setuptools is a primarily a build/packaging system.
    setuptools may want to use distlib support at some point, as it grows to support newer PEPs.
