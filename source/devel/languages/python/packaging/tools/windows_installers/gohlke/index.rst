Unofficial Windows Binaries for Python Extension Packages 
by Christoph Gohlke, Laboratory for Fluorescence Dynamics, 
University of California, Irvine.

This page provides 32- and 64-bit Windows binaries of many scientific 
open-source extension packages for the official CPython distribution of 
the Python programming language.

The files are unofficial (meaning: informal, unrecognized, personal, 
unsupported) and made available for testing and evaluation purposes.

If downloads fail reload this page, enable JavaScript, disable download 
managers, disable proxies, clear cache, and use Firefox. 
Please only download files as needed.

Most binaries are built from source code found on PyPI or in the projects 
public revision control systems. 
Source code changes, if any, have been submitted to the project maintainers 
or are included in the packages.

Refer to the documentation of the individual packages for license 
restrictions and dependencies.

Many binaries depend on:

- Numpy-MKL 1.7 
- and/or the Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 (64 bit or 32 bit, for CPython 2.6 to 3.2) 
- or Visual C++ 2010 (64 bit or 32 bit, for CPython 3.3 and 3.4) redistributable packages.

The binaries are compatible with the official CPython distribution 
on Windows >=6.0. 

Chances are they don't work with custom Python distributions included 
with Blender, Maya, ArcGIS, OSGeo4W, Cygwin, Pythonxy, Canopy, EPD, 
Anaconda, WinPython etc. Some binaries are not compatible 
with Windows XP or Wine.
