    Sujet:  Documentation Consolidation on PyPA.io

So I’ve setup the pip, virtualenv, and warehouse documentation to live at:

    pip.pypa.io, virtualenv.pypa.io, and warehouse.pypa.io

I would like to do the same for setuptools. I wonder if jaraco would be OK
with moving setuptools documentation to RTD, then I can handle it just like
the other docs and there will be parity between them all.

Things still left to do:

* Enable Redirects from the old domains to the new one
* Enable TLS
* Something with the Apex domain

The first one I'll get done in a little while, the second one we're waiting on
Fastly to get the certificate issued, and the third one I'm looking for ideas :)
