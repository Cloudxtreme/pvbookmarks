So you want to write a library that compiles into a DLL or something of that 
sort and it should be somewhat platform independent. 

Which languages can you actually use there? Right now you can pick between 
C and C++ and soon you might also be able to add Rust to that list.


For other languages that's not so easy however. Why for instance is it not a 
good idea to write a library in Go? The reason for this is that Go for needs 
quite a heavy runtime that does garbage collection and provides a scheduler 
for it's coroutines. 

Rust is getting closer to not having any runtime requirements besides the C 
standard library which will make it possible to write libraries in it.
