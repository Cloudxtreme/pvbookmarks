C# 4 is even more expressive and powerful than earlier versions.
You can do amazing things with generics, lambda expressions, dynamic typing,
LINQ, iterator blocks, and other features—but you first have to learn C# in depth.

C# in Depth, Second Edition is a thoroughly revised, up-to-date book that covers
the new features of C# 4 as well as Code Contracts.

In it, you'll see the subtleties of C# programming in action, learning how to
work with high-value features that you'll be glad to have in your toolkit.

The book helps readers avoid hidden pitfalls of C# programming by understanding
"behind the scenes" issues.
