C# 6: First reactions
======================

It's been a scandalously long time since I've blogged about C#, and now that 
the first C# 6 preview bits are available, that feels like exactly the right 
thing to set the keys clacking again. 

Don't expect anything massively insightful from me just yet; I'd heard Mads and 
Dustin (individually) talk about some new features of C# 6 at conferences, but 
this is the first opportunity I've had to play with the bits. 

There are more features to come, and I suspect that the ones we've got aren't 
in quite the shape they'll be in the end.
