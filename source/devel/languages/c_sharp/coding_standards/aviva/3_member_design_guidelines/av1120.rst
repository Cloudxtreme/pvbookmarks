=============================================================================
AV1120 Use a public static readonly field to define predefined value objects
=============================================================================

For example, consider a Color struct that stores a color internally as red, green,
and blue components and this class has a constructor taking a numeric representation.
This class may expose several predefined colors like this::


    public struct Color
    {
        public static readonly Color Red = new Color(0xFF0000);
        public static readonly Color Black = new Color(0x000000);
        public static readonly Color White = new Color(0xFFFFFF);
        public Color(int redGreenBlue)
        {
            // implementation
        }
    }
