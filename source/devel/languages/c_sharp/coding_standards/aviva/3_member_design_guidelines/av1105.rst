==============================================
AV1105 Use a method instead of a property
==============================================

- If the operation is orders of magnitude slower than setting a field value.
- If the operation is a conversion, such as the Object.ToString method.
- If the operation returns a different result each time it is called, even if
  the parameters didnâ€™t change. For example, the NewGuid method returns a
  different value each time it is called.
- If the operation causes a side effect such as changing some internal state
  not directly related the property.

.. note:: populating an internal cache or implementing lazy loading is a good
   exception.
