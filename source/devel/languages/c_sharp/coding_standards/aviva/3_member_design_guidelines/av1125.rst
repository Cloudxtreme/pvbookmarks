===========================================================
AV1125 Don’t expose stateful objects through static members
===========================================================


A stateful object is an object that contains many properties and lots of behavior
behind that.

If you expose such an object through a static property or method of some other
object, it will be very difficult to refactor or unit test a class that relies
on such a stateful object.

In general, introducing a construction like that is a great example of violating
many of the guidelines of this chapter.

A classic example of this is the ``HttpContext.Current`` property, part of ASP.NET.

It’s very difficult to unit test a class like that without using a very
intelligent and intrusive mocking framework such as TypeMock Isolator.

Many see the HttpContext class as a source for a lot of ugly code. In fact, the
testing guideline `Isolate the Ugly Stuff`_ often refers to this class.
