AV1140 Consider replacing properties using primitive types to use rich value objects
====================================================================================

Instead of using strings, integers and decimals for representing domain specific
types such as an ISBN number, an email address or amount of money, **consider
created dedicated value objects that wrap both the data and the validation rules
that apply to it**.

By doing this, you prevent ending up having multiple implementations of the same
business rules, which both improves maintainability and prevents bugs.
