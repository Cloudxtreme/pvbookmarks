========================================
AV1110 Avoid mutual exclusive properties
========================================

Having properties that cannot be used at the same time typically signals a type
that is representing two conflicting concepts.

Even though those concepts may share some of the behavior and state, they
obviously have different rules that do not cooperate.

This violation is often seen in domain models and introduces all kinds of
conditional logic related to those conflicting rules, causing a ripple effect
that significantly worsens the maintenance burden.
