==========================
AV2400 Use a common layout
==========================


- Keep the length of each line under 130 characters.
- Use an indentation of 4 whitespaces, and don’t use Tabs
- Keep one whitespace between keywords like if and the expression, but don’t
  add whitespaces after ( and before ) such as::

      if (condition == null)

- Add a whitespace around operators, like +, -, ==, etc.
- Always succeed the keywords if, else, do, while, for and foreach, with opening
  and closing parentheses, even though the language does not require it.
- Always put opening and closing parentheses on a new line.
- Don’t indent object Initializers and initialize each property on a new line,
  so use a format like this::

      var dto = new ConsumerDto()
      {
          Id = 123,
          Name = “Microsoft”,
          PartnerShip = PartnerShip.Gold,
      }

- Don’t indent lambda statements and use a format like this::

       methodThatTakesAnAction.Do(x =>
       {
           // do something like this
       })


- Put the entire LINQ statement on one line, or start each keyword at the same
  indentation, like this::

      var query = from product in products where product.Price > 10 select product;

  or::

      var query =
         from product in products
         where product.Price > 10
         select product;

- Add braces around every comparison condition, but don’t add braces around a
  singular condition. For example::

      if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(str) && (str != “new”))

- Add an empty line between multi-line statements, between members, after the
  closing parentheses, between unrelated code blocks, around the #region keyword,
  and between the using statements of different companies.
