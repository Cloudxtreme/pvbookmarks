====================================
AV2407 Be reluctant with #regions
====================================


Regions can be helpful, but can also hide the main purpose of a class.

Therefore, use #regions only for:

- Private fields and constants (preferably in a Private Definitions region).
- Nested classes
- Interface implementations (only if the interface is not the main purpose of
  that class)
