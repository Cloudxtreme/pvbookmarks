============================================
AV2406 Place members in a well-defined order
============================================

Maintaining a common order allows other team members to find their way in your
code more easily.

In general, a source file should be readable from top to bottom, as if you are
reading a book.

This prevents readers from having to browse up and down through the code file.

1. Private fields and constants (in a region)
2. Public constants
3. Public read-only static fields
4. Constructors and the Finalizer
5. Events
6. Properties
7. Other members grouped in a functional manner.
8. Private properties

Private and protected methods should be placed behind the public member in
calling order.
