===========================================================
AV1025 Classes should have state and behavior
===========================================================


The only exception to this rule are classes that are used to transfer data over
a communication channel, also called Data Transfer Objects, or a class that
wraps several parameters of a method.

In general, if you find a lot of data-only classes in your code base, you
probably also have a few (static) classes with a lot of behavior.

Use the principles of object-orientation explained in this section and move the
logic as close to the data it applies to.
