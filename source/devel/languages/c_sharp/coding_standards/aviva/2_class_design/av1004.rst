===============================================================================
AV1004 Use an interface to support multiple implementations, not a base class
===============================================================================

If you want to expose an extension point to your class, expose it as an
interface rather than a base class.

It doesnâ€™t force the users of that extension point to derive their
implementations from a base-class that might have undesired behavior.

It improves testability and allows them to use their own implementation.

However, for their convenience you may implement an (abstract) default
implementation that can serve as a starting point.
