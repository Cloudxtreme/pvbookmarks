.. _av1003:

=================================================
AV1003 An interface should be small and focused
=================================================


Interfaces should have a clear name explaining the purpose or role of that
interface within the system.

Do not combine many vaguely related members on the same interface, just
because they were all on the same class.

Separate the members based on the responsibility of those members so that
callers only need to call or implement the interface related to a particular task.

This rule is more commonly known as the :term:`Interface Segregation Principle`.
