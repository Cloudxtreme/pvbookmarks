AV1005 Use an interface to decouple classes from each other
============================================================

Interfaces are a very effective mechanism for decoupling classes from each
other and:

-  They can prevent bidirectional associations;
-  They simplify the replacement of one implementation with another;
-  They allow replacing an expensive external service or resource with a
   temporary stub for use in a non-production environment.
-  They allow replacing the actual implementation with a dummy implementation
   in a unit test;
-  Using a dependency injection framework you can centralize the choice which
   class is going to be used whenever a specific interface is requested.
