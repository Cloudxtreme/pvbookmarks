AV1008 Mark classes that only contain static members as static
==============================================================

The advantage of using a static class is that the compiler can make sure that
no instance members are accidentally defined.

The compiler will guarantee that instances of this class cannot be created and
hence, relieves you of creating a private constructor such as was required
in C# 1.0.

Use a static class to contain methods that are not associated with a particular
instance. For example::

    public static class EuroConversion {
        public static Decimal FromUSD(Decimal inUsd) { ... }
        public static Decimal ToUSD(Decimal inEuro) { ... }
    }
