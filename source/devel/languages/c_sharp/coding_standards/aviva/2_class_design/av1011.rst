.. _av1011:

==========================================================================================
AV1011 It should be possible to treat a derived object as if it were a base class object
==========================================================================================


In other words, it should be possible to use a reference to an object of a
derived class wherever a reference to its base class object is used without
knowing the specific derived class.

A very notorious example of a violation of this rule is throwing a
NotImplementedException when overriding some of the base-class methods.

A less subtle example is not honoring the behavior expected by the base-class.

This rule is also known as the :term:`Liskov Substitution Principle`, one of the S.O.L.I.D. principles.
