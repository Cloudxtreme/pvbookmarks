11 Important Resources
=======================


11.1 The companion website
==========================

.. seealso:: http:://www.csharpcodingguidelines.com.

This document is part of an effort to increase the consciousness with which
C# developers do their daily job on a professional level.

Therefore I’ve started a dedicated CodePlex site that can be easily found using
the URL http:://www.csharpcodingguidelines.com.


In addition to the most up to date version of this document, you’ll find:

-  A companion quick-reference sheet
-  Visual Studio 2010 Rule Sets for different types of systems.
-  ReSharper 5 layout configurations matching the rules in chapter 8.
-  A place to start discussions on C# coding quality.


11.2 Useful links
=================

In addition to the many links provided throughout this document, I’d like to
recommend the following books, articles and sites for everyone interests in
software quality.

Code Complete: A Practical Handbook of Software Construction (Steve McConnel)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. seealso:: http://www.amazon.com/dp/0735619670/ref=rdr_ext_tmb

 One of the best books I’ve ever read.

It deals with all aspects of software development, and even though the book was
originally written in 2004, but you’ll be surprised when you see how accurate
it still is. I wrote a review in 2009 if you want to get a sense of its contents.


The Art of Agile Development (James Shore)
------------------------------------------

.. seealso:: http://www.amazon.com/Art-Agile-Development-James-Shore/dp/0596527675

Another great all-encompassing trip through the many practices preached by
processes like Scrum and Extreme Programming. If you’re looking for a quick
introduction with a pragmatic touch, make sure you read James’ book.


Applying Domain Driven-Design and Patterns: With Examples in C# and .NET (Jimmy Nilsson)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. seealso:: http://www.amazon.com/Applying-Domain-Driven-Design-Patterns-Examples/dp/0321268202

The book that started my interest for both Domain Driven Design and Test Driven
Development. It’s one of those books that I wished I had read a few years earlier.

It would have saved me from many mistakes.


Jeremy D. Miller’s Blog
-----------------------

.. seealso:: http://codebetter.com/jeremymiller/

Although he is not that active anymore, in the last couple of years he has
written some excellent blog posts on Test Driven Development, Design Patterns
and design principles. I’ve learned a lot from his real-life and practical
insights.


LINQ Framework Design Guidelines
---------------------------------

.. seealso:: http://blogs.msdn.com/b/mirceat/archive/2008/03/13/linq-framework-design-guidelines.aspx

A set of rules and recommendations that you should adhere to when creating your
own implementations of IQueryable<T>.
