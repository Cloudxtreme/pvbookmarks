Introduction
============

The most widely used Object-Oriented Programming languages (Java, C++, C#, Android,
Objective C) are all roughly the same; so long as one does not enter device-dependent
programming (GUI, H/W, ...).

The core constructs of these languages can be translated into one another.

GOOL stands for General Object-Oriented Language. It is not yet another concrete
language, but rather, an abstract intermediate language which stands for whatever
is common in all these Object-Oriented Programmming (OOP) languages.

At the moment the GOOL system takes a Java input and produces a C++, C# output.

Thus, as it stands, the GOOL program is a lightweight core-Java to core- C++,
C# translator generating clean, readable code.
