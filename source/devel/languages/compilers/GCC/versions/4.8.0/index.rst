Dear gcc follower,

barsnick just announced version 4.8.0 of gcc on Freecode.

The release notes for this version are as follows:

- **GCC is now implemented in C++**
- DWARF4 is now the default when generating DWARF debug information 
  (tool support required).
- A new general optimization level "-Og" was introduced.
- AddressSanitizer, a fast memory error detector, was added.
- ThreadSanitizer was added (x86-64 only) for instrumenting instructions
  to detect data races.
- C++11 was enhanced with support for the thread_local keyword, for 
  attribute syntax, for the alignment specifier, and for inheriting constructors.
- Support for AArch64 as well as ARMv8 AArch32 extensions was added.
- Various other improvements and bugfixes were made.
