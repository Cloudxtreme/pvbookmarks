The Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 SP1 Redistributable Package installs runtime 
components of Visual C++ Libraries required to run applications developed 
with Visual C++ SP1 on a computer that does not have Visual C++ 2008 SP1 
installed.

These packages install runtime components of C Runtime (CRT), Standard C++, 
ATL, MFC, OpenMP and MSDIA libraries. 

For libraries that support side-by-side deployment model (CRT, SCL, ATL, MFC, 
OpenMP) they are installed into the native assembly cache, also called WinSxS 
folder, on versions of Windows operating system that support side-by-side 
assemblies.
