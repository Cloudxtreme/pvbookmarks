Introduction
=============
  
Microsoft Visual C++ (often abbreviated as MSVC or VC++ or **VC**) is a commercial 
(free version available), integrated development environment (IDE) product 
from Microsoft for the C, C++, and C++/CLI programming languages. 

It features tools for developing and debugging C++ code, especially code 
written for the Microsoft Windows API, the DirectX API, and the Microsoft 
.NET Framework.

**Many applications require redistributable Visual C++ packages to function 
correctly**. 

These packages are often installed independently of applications, allowing 
multiple applications to make use of the package while only having to 
install it once. 

These Visual C++ redistributable and runtime packages are mostly installed 
for standard libraries that many `applications make use of`_.
