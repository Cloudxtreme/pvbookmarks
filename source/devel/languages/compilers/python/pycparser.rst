pycparser is a complete parser of the C language, written in pure Python using
the PLY parsing library. It parses C code into an AST and can serve as a
front-end for C compilers or analysis tools.

pycparser is a complete parser for the C language, written in pure Python.
It is a module designed to be easily integrated into applications that need to
parse C source code.

The following are some uses for pycparser, taken from real user reports:

- C code obfuscator
- Front-end for various specialized C compilers
- Static code checker
- Automatic unit-test discovery
- Adding specialized extensions to the C language

pycparser is also referenced in a few academic theses and papers, mainly on
the topic of parallel computing, where it's being used to translate a set of
parallel extensions for the C language, down to plain C.
