Introduction
============

Blockly is a web-based, graphical programming language. Users can drag blocks
together to build an application.

No typing required.

Blockly is currently a technology preview. We want developers to be able to play
with Blockly, give feedback, and think of novel uses for it.

All the code is free and open source. Join the `mailing list`_ and let us know what
you think.
