What is Lua ?
==============

Lua is a powerful, fast, lightweight, embeddable scripting language.

Lua combines simple procedural syntax with powerful data description constructs 
based on associative arrays and extensible semantics. 

Lua is dynamically typed, runs by interpreting bytecode for a register-based 
virtual machine, and has automatic memory management with incremental garbage 
collection, making it ideal for configuration, scripting, and rapid prototyping. 


What's in a name ?
====================

"Lua" (pronounced LOO-ah) means "Moon" in Portuguese. 

As such, it is neither an acronym nor an abbreviation, but a noun. 

More specifically, "Lua" is a name, the name of the Earth's moon and the name 
of the language. 

Like most names, it should be written in lower case with an initial capital, 
that is, "Lua". 

Please do not write it as "LUA", which is both ugly and confusing, because then 
it becomes an acronym with different meanings for different people. 

So, please, write "Lua" right!
