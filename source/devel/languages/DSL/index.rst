In software development and domain engineering, a domain-specific language 
(DSL) is a programming language or specification language dedicated to a 
particular problem domain, a particular problem representation technique, 
and/or a particular solution technique. The concept isn't new—special-purpose 
programming languages and all kinds of modeling/specification languages have 
always existed, but the term has become more popular due to the rise of 
domain-specific modeling.

Examples of domain-specific languages include HTML, Logo for children, 
Verilog and VHSIC hardware description languages, Mata for matrix programming, 
Mathematica and Maxima for symbolic mathematics, spreadsheet formulas and 
macros, SQL for relational database queries, YACC grammars for creating parsers, 
regular expressions for specifying lexers, the Generic Eclipse Modeling System 
for creating diagramming languages, Csound for sound and music synthesis, and 
the input languages of GraphViz and GrGen, software packages used for graph 
layout and graph rewriting.

The opposite is:

- a general-purpose programming language, such as C, Java or Python,
- or a general-purpose modeling language such as the Unified Modeling Language 
  (UML).
