Description
============


6to5 turns ES6+ code into vanilla ES5, so you can use next generation features 
today.

- Readable - formatting is retained if possible so your generated code is as 
  similar as possible.
- Extensible - with a large range of plugins and browser support.
- Lossless - source map support so you can debug your compiled code with ease.
- Compact - maps directly to the equivalent ES5 with no runtime*.
