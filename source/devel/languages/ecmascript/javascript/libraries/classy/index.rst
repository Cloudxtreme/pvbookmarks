Introduction
=============   

Classy is a library for JavaScript that provides Python inspired class support 
for JavaScript on top of the existing prototype based object system. It can be 
used with zero-footprint which allows its use in injected JavaScript code 
without breaking the existing website.

It supports the builtin isinstance operator, mixin classes, class and instance 
attributes as well as simplified calls into super methods.

It creates one global object called Class that can be renamed and transparently 
moved into an anonymous scope, leaving no trace behind on the global namespace.
