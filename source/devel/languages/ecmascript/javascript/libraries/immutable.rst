Introduction
=============   


Immutable data cannot be changed once created, leading to much simpler 
application development and enabling techniques from functional programming such 
as lazy evaluation. 

Immutable JS provides a lazy Sequence, allowing efficient chaining of sequence 
methods like map and filter without creating intermediate representations.

immutable provides Sequence, Range, Repeat, Map, OrderedMap, Set and a sparse 
Vector by using lazy sequences and hash maps tries. 

They achieve efficiency by using structural sharing and minimizing the need to 
copy or cache data.
