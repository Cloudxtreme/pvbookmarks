What Is Sails.js ?
===================

Sails makes it easy to build custom, enterprise-grade Node.js apps. 

It is designed to emulate the familiar MVC pattern of frameworks like Ruby on 
Rails, but with support for the requirements of modern apps: data-driven APIs 
with a scalable, service-oriented architecture. 

It's especially good for building chat, realtime dashboards, or multiplayer 
games; but you can use it for any web application project - top to bottom.
