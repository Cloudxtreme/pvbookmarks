What is jQuery ?
================

jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library. 

It makes things like HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling, 
animation, and Ajax much simpler with an easy-to-use API that works across a 
multitude of browsers. 

With a combination of versatility and extensibility, jQuery has changed the way 
that millions of people write JavaScript.
