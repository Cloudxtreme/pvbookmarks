What Is Sails.js ?
===================

Ember.js is an open-source client-side JavaScript web application framework 
based on the model-view-controller (MVC) software architectural pattern. 

It allows developers to create scalable single-page applications by 
incorporating common idioms and best practices into a framework that provides 
a rich object model, declarative two-way data binding, computed properties, 
automatically-updating templates powered by Handlebars.js, and a router for 
managing application state
