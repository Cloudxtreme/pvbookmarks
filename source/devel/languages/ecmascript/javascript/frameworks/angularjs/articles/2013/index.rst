A ReSTful API is becoming a standard component of any modern web application. 

The Django Rest Framework is powerful framework for developing ReST endpoints 
for your Django based project. 

AngularJS is modern javascript framework for creating complex web applications 
within the browser. 
It focuses on strong separation of concerns (MVC) and dependency injection to 
encourage creating maintainable (and testable) modules that can be integrated 
to develop rich client side functionality.

In this blog post, I'll walk through creating a sample project that exposes 
a ReST API consumed by AngularJS on the client to showcase how to combine the 
frontend and backend frameworks to simplify creating complex applications. 

I'll make heavy use of code examples to demonstrate both the solution and the 
process and there's a `companion Github project with all the code`_.
