Description
============

The C++14 release is considered a minor release, whereas the forthcoming C++17 
standard (still under design and in discussions) is considered a major release.  

Microsoft’s most recent compiler preview (CTP) was released this past November.  

The next CTP (announce date yet to be given) is expected to contain the following 
features with a high degree of confidence according to Sutter:

- User-defined literals
- C++14 generalized lambda capture
- C++14 libs: std:: user-defined literals
- Inline namespaces
