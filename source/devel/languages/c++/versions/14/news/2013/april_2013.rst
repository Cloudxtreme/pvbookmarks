Some words on C++14. C++14 is not going to be like C++11 changing the language
a lot.

Its more meant to enhance the language with libraries, and improve or provide
bug fixes for C++11.

That’s why you could call C++14 a minor Standard, and the next major C++ Standard
is C++17, at least you could see this as the current plan and road map for C++.
