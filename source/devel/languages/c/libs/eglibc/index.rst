Overview
=========

Embedded GLIBC (EGLIBC) is a variant of the GNU C Library (GLIBC) that is designed
to work well on embedded systems.

EGLIBC strives to be source and binary compatible with GLIBC.

EGLIBC's goals include reduced footprint, configurable components, better support
for cross-compilation and cross-testing.
