Introduction
=============

The primary goal of this Project was to produce an open-source implementation 
of the seventh edition of the Java SE Platform, as defined by JSR 336 in 
the Java Community Process.

JDK 7 reached General Availability on 28 July 2011. Production-ready 
binary distributions based on the JDK 7 code base are available now 
from Oracle and will be available soon in most Linux distributions and 
from Oracle's Java SE licensees.

Detailed information on the main features of the release can be found 
on the features page. 

The JDK 7 development schedule was divided into a sequence of milestone 
cycles. A complete calendar of the entire development timeline is also available.

Development of JDK 7 update releases is being done in the nearby JDK 7 
Updates Project.

History
========

After Oracle acquired Sun we replanned JDK 7 according to the "Plan B" 
proposal in order to accelerate its release while maintaining performance 
and quality. 

Features that needed more time to mature were deferred to JDK 8 or later 
releases as explained here. A handful of small, high-impact features 
which were not previously part of the plan but were finished, or nearly 
so, were added to the release.
