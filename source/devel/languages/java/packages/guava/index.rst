Introduction
=============

The Guava project contains several of Google's core libraries that we rely on 
in our Java-based projects: collections, caching, primitives support, 
concurrency libraries, common annotations, string processing, I/O, and so forth.

The latest release is 15.0, released September 6, 2013.
