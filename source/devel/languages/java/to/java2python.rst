Introduction
=============


Simple but effective tool to translate Java source code into Python.

The java2python package can translate any syntactically valid Java source code
file.

The generated Python code is not guaranteed to run, nor is guaranteed to be
syntactically valid Python.

However, java2python works well many cases, and in some of those, it creates
perfectly usable and workable Python code.
