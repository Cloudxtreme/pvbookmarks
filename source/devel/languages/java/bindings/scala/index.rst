"The biggest selling point for certain organizations is that Scala is 100 per
cent compatible with your existing JVM code. There's no wrappers. There's no
bullshit. You just load up your JVM code and call in to it, and there's no
performance penalty. If you have a big investment in Java infrastructure,
Scala is the ideal language."
