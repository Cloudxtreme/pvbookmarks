SWIG (Simplified Wrapper and Interface Generator) is an open source software
tool used to connect computer programs or libraries written in C or C++
with scripting languages such as Lua, Perl, PHP, Python, R, Ruby, Tcl, and
other languages like C#, Java, Modula-3, Objective Caml, Octave, and Scheme.
Output can also be in the form of XML or Lisp S-expressions

QuantLib is available as a C#, Guile, Java, MzScheme, Perl, Python, and Ruby
module by means of SWIG. Experimental bindings to GNU R and Objective Caml are
also available; feedback is welcome.

Compilation of the Java module on Windows is performed by means of sKWash.
A guide to the process can be found here. A guide to the compilation of the
Java module on Linux is available here.
