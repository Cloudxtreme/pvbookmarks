Introduction
=============

PHP 5.6.0., considered a very important cornerstone by many, has been released 
today. 

We’ve talked about the changes this version brings in previous posts, and others 
have written about it, too.

Recap
=====


To recap quickly:

- MIME types in the CLI web server have been added
- Internal Operator Overloading
- Uploads of over 2GB are now accepted
- POST data memory usage decreased and ::/input is reusable
- Improved syntax for variadic functions, functions that can accept an 
  arbitrary number of arguments
- Argument unpacking
- Constant Scalar Expressions
- PHPDBG bundled by default
- Zip improved
- Importing namespaced functions and constants
- Exponentiation ($a = 2**3;)
- Default UTF-8
- GMP operator overloading

What now ?
============

So what’s next? While the internals group is working on PHPNG and PHP7, whatever 
those may end up being called, take the time to get familiar with PHP 5.6.
