	subject	[Muscle] I now have a blog to talk about smart cards
	
Hello,

I created  a blog to talk about smart card in general and pcsc-lite,
libccid and other projects I work on in particular. I am not a
blogger, this is my first blog.

- http://ludovicrousseau.blogspot.com/
- http://smartcard-atr.appspot.com/

I have two posts for now:

- Parsing an ATR
- PC/SC sample in different languages

I don't know if I should also post my blog messages on this mailing
list. Do you have any opinion on this?

Enjoy

I have blog on smart cards, but on the contactless and dual interface ones :)

Mainly focused on the application and functionality level, rather than 
coding like Ludovic's one.

Regards,
