Our Story
==========

ProtonMail was founded in summer 2013 at CERN by scientists who were drawn 
together by a shared vision of a more secure and private Internet. 

Early ProtonMail hackathons were held at the famous CERN Restaurant One. 

ProtonMail is developed both at CERN and MIT and is headquartered in Geneva, 
Switzerland. We were semifinalists in 2014 MIT 100K startup launch competition 
and are advised by the MIT Venture Mentoring Service.
