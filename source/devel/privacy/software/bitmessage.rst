What is DIME ?
===================

Bitmessage is a P2P communications protocol used to send encrypted messages to 
another person or to many subscribers. 

It is decentralized and trustless, meaning that you need-not inherently trust 
any entities like root certificate authorities. 

It uses strong authentication which means that the sender of a message cannot 
be spoofed, and it aims to hide "non-content" data, like the sender and receiver 
of messages, from passive eavesdroppers like those running warrantless 
wiretapping programs. 
If Bitmessage is completely new to you, you may wish to start by reading the
