What is DIME ?
===================

Email was not originally intended to be cryptographically hidden 
from prying eyes, but one-click, end-to-end email encryption is just what 
Ladar Levison is within six months of achieving.

Or it will be, he told a standing room-only audience of around 2,000 hackers 
and security experts at DefCon on Friday evening, if all goes according to plan.

Levison is the founder of the webmail service Lavabit that is widely believed 
to have been used by Edward Snowden. 
Levison shuttered it rather than hand over Lavabit's encryption keys and source 
code to the US government.

He told the enthusiastic crowd that his DarkMail project has expanded.

Now called the Dark Internet Mail Environment, or DIME, it's an ecosystem 
comprised of email transfer protocols DMAP and DMTP, the email server Magma, 
and a Mozilla Thunderbird-based desktop email client called Volcano.

"DarkMail combines all my knowledge of security and email into one last hurrah," 
Levison said in a conversation with CNET following his DefCon presentation 
where he used DarkMail and DIME interchangeably.
