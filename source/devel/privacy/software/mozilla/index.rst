============

As many people know, Mozilla jumped into Do Not Track (DNT) in a big way earlier
this year by providing Firefox users on desktop and mobile with a simple way to

We did this before knowing exactly how sites and advertisers would respond.
We believed we had to do something to advance the debate and we counted on
developers seeing the technical advantages to our approach over current
proposals and practices.
