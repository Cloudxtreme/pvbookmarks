Introduction
============

``Privacy`` (from Latin: privatus "separated from the rest, deprived of something,
esp. office, participation in the government", from privo "to deprive") is the
ability of an individual or group to seclude themselves or information about
themselves and thereby reveal themselves selectively.
The boundaries and content of what is considered private differ among cultures
and individuals, but share basic common themes. Privacy is sometimes related
to anonymity, the wish to remain unnoticed or unidentified in the public
realm. When something is private to a person, it usually means there is
something within them that is considered inherently special or personally
sensitive.

The degree to which private information is exposed therefore depends on how
the public will receive this information, which differs between places and
over time. Privacy is broader than security and includes the concepts of
appropriate use and protection of information.
