The GlobalPlatform_ card specification provides a standard for the management of
the contents on a smart card. Mainly this comprises the installation and the
removal of applications.

A good overview of the GlobalPlatform card specification is given on this page:
`GlobalPlatform card specification`_. Due to the missing support of free software
supporting the GlobalPlatform card specification this project was founded by
Karsten Ohme.

This project offers a C library and a command line shell.

You can support this project with donations. The money will be used for the
support of the ongoing development e.g. buy of smart cards, NFC phones and
card readers.
