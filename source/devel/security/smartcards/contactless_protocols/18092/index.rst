Near Field Communication or NFC, is a short-range high frequency wireless 
communication technology which enables the exchange of data between devices 
over about a 10 centimetre (around 4 inches) distance.[1]  
The technology is a simple extension of the ISO/IEC 14443 proximity-card 
standard (contactless card, RFID) that combines the interface of a 
smartcard and a reader into a single device. An NFC device can communicate 
with both existing ISO/IEC 14443 smartcards and readers, as well as with 
other NFC devices, and is thereby compatible with existing contactless 
infrastructure already in use for public transportation and payment. 
NFC is primarily aimed at usage in mobile phones.
