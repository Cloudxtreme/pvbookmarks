What is NFC ?
=============

For those that don’t know, NFC is a hot new technology that will make mobile
devices that much more powerful and important in our lives. It gives users the
ability to interact with other devices that are nearby. Think about buying a
soda from a vending machine simply by waving your phone at it, or printing
pictures from your mobile by setting it down on top of your printer.

At the show here there are many examples of NFC.

First, what can Qt do with NFC ?
================================

Qt and the Qt Mobility APIs make it possible to integrate with stores and more.
The upcoming release of Qt Mobility (1.2) features the Connectivity API, which
allows NFC enabled phones such as the Nokia C7 to recognise NFC tags.

What are we demonstrating ?
===========================

Digia, one of our certified Qt partners has produced a nifty demo that previews
what Qt can do in the NFC space. They have created an app called ShopWizer that
currently runs on a Nokia C7. Applications such as Shopwizer are made possible
by this API, and Digia used a technical preview version of the Connectivity
API from Qt Mobility 1.2 to build the demo.
