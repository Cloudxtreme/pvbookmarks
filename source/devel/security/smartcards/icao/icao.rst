Doc 9303, Machine Readable Travel Documents

Part 1 - Machine Readable Passports
-----------------------------------

The Sixth Edition, in two volumes, was published in September 2006. 
Volume 1 set forth the specifications for a machine readable passport (MRP),  
characterized by a visual inspection zone and a machine readable zone (MRZ) 
containing essential identification and document details in OCR-B typeface. 

Volume 2 Sets forth the specifications for biometric enhancement of the 
MRP to become an "e-Passport".

Part 2 - Machine Readable Visas
-------------------------------

The third Edition was published in 2005. Specifications provide for a visa 
format in two sizes - Format A, sized to fill a passport page, and the 
smaller format B. Like the MRP the machine readable visa is a standard 
format consisting of a visual inspection zone and a machine readable zone. 

However, the Third Edition requires that a space be provided for a portrait 
of the holder, and fewer layout options than the previous edition allowed.

Part 3 - Machine Readable Official Travel Documents
---------------------------------------------------

The third Edition, Part 3, published in 2008, updates and replaces 
the specifications for machine readable official travel documents 
as published in the second edition (2002) and represents a substantial 
modernization of the material contained in previous editions. 

In particular, this third edition incorporates the optional new globally 
interoperable standard for biometric identification of the holder and for 
the storage of the associated data on a contactless integrated circuit. 

Volume 1 is an updated version of the second edition containing all the 
specifications required for a State wishing to issue a machine readable 
official travel document without the incorporation of machine-assisted 
biometric identification. 

Volume 2 contains the specifications for enhancing the machine readable
official travel document with the globally interoperable system of 
biometic identification and its associated data storage utilizing 
a contactless integrated circuit.


Specifications common to all parts are:

* recommended transliterations of national characters, and
* 3- letter codes for nationality and the issuing entity.
