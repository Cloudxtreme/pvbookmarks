In 2004, the ICAO published a new version of Doc9303 that defines the
specifications of the electronic passports, known as ePassports.

These passports, easily recognizable with their logo on the front cover, contain
a passive contactless chip featured with some cryptographic mecanisms.

ePassport Viewer is a GPL-friendly tool to read and checks ePassports, developped
by Jean-Francois Houzard and Olivier Roger during their Master Thesis achieved
in the Information Security Group of the UCL in Belgium. ePassport Viewer is
currently available as beta version.
