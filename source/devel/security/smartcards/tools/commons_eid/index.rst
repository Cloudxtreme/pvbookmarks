Introduction
=============

Welcome to the project site of the FedICT Commons eID Project. 

The Commons eID project delivers several artifacts to enable the Belgian eID 
within your Java based applications.

The architecture of the Commons eID project is specially tailored to be able 
to serve both desktop applications as well as web browser applets. 

Desktop applications will basically use all artifacts together whereas applets 
will use the client only within the actual applet, and will use the consumer 
at the server-side.

Furthermore the Commons eID project delivers an eID specific JCA security 
provider. 

This gives you seamless integration of the eID card into the security architecture 
of Java.
