Scripting Server is a runtime environment for web applications written in 
JavaScript. 

It is the server based equivalent to the Smart Card Shell and allows easy 
prototyping and testing of cryptographic services and simple web applications.

It provides for a uniform processing environment that can be used to implement 
a wide range of applications like

- Card personalisation servers
- Data preparation systems
- Key management server
- PKI web services (e.g. EAC-PKI)

and many more.
