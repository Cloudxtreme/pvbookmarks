Introduction
============


The Open Smart Card Development Platform (OpenSCDP) is a collection of tools 
for the development, test and deployment of smart card and public key 
infrastructure applications. 

It uses the capabilities of Global Platform Scripting, Profile and Messaging 
technology to provide unsurpassed flexibility and development speed.

The tools are written in Java and use JavaScript as scripting language. 
Smart card access is provided through an enhanced version of the OpenCard Framework. 

Drivers are included for most ISO 7816-4 based smart cards, PC/SC and CT-API 
card readers. 

The platform provides full cryptographic support for algorithms commonly used 
by smart cards.

Tools, libraries and documentation for the Open Smart Card Development Platform 
are provided as Open Source under the GNU Public License (GPL). 

The software can be downloaded and used free of charge.
