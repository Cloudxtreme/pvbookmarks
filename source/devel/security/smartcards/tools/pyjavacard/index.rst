Introduction
============

A pure Python implementation of the JavaCard framework

This is a pure python version of the javacard operating system as found on
javacard smartcards.

It does not provides much on his own beside the functionnalities of the
Operating System, as such, it is often used in combination with others projects
like CAPRunner (linked via .CAP files) or WebSCard (through CAPRunner or python
versions of Applets).

Documentation on this project is better found as original JavaCard documentation
(ask Google).

The goal is to replication the exact same functionnalities.

If your experience is other, please fill in a bug report. Please do the same for
missing functionnalities. As for now, I only implemented the functionnalities
I was needing during my various tests.
