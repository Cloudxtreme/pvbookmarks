Program protection and reverse engineering are dualisms of good and evil.
Beneficial uses of reverse engineering abound: malicious software needs to be
analyzed and understood in order to prevent their spread and to assess their
functional footprint; owners of intellectual property (IP) at times need to
recover lost or unmaintained designs. Conversely, malicious reverse engineering
allows illegal copying and subversion and designers can employ obfuscation and
tamper-proofing on IP to target various attack vectors. In this sense,
protecting IP and protecting malware from detection and analysis is a
double-edged sword: depending on the context, the same techniques are either
beneficial or harmful. Likewise, tools that deobfuscate malware in good contexts
become analysis methods that support reverse engineering for illegal activity.
