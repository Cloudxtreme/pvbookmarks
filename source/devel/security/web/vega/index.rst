Vega is an open source platform to test the security of web applications.

Vega can help you find and validate SQL Injections, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS),
inadvertently disclosed sensitive information, and other vulnerabilities.

It is written in Java, GUI based, and runs on Linux, OS X, and Windows.

Vega includes an automated scanner for quick tests and an intercepting proxy
for tactical inspection. Vega can be extended using a powerful API in the
language of the web: Javascript_ .

    Hey,

    We've been quietly working for the last few months on a new platform for
    scanning and pen-testing web applications. It's called Vega. It's
    GUI-based, open source, and includes an automated scanner and
    intercepting proxy. We launched the beta today at FISL12.

    Vega is written in Java, based on Eclipse RCP, and runs nicely on OS X,
    Linux, and Windows.

    Vega is also really extensible: there's an embedded Javascript
    interpreter for writing custom modules. The rich API is documented on
    our Trac wiki. Nearly all of the vulnerability checks are Javascript
    modules, and it's very easy to write new ones.

    Vega is developed by Subgraph in Montreal and is licensed under the EPL
    1.0.

    Download Vega 1.0 Beta at http://www.subgraph.com. You can find us in
    #subgraph on freenode.

    Looking forward to hearing beta feedback.
