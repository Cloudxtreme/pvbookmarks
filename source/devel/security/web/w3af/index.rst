===============================================


.. image:: w3af_logo.png


w3af is a Web Application Attack and Audit Framework.

The project's goal is to create a framework to find and exploit web application
vulnerabilities that is easy to use and extend.

W3af Short term objectives
==========================

The project's short term objectives, which are planned to be achieved in 2009
are:

- Duplicate the amount of w3af community members
- w3af is much more than a piece of software, w3af is a community that breathes
  Web Application Security. Our goal has to be to duplicate the amount of
  community members.
  Community members start threads in the mailing list, promote w3af in
  information security conferences, contribute with patches, feature requests
  and bug reports. Without a supporting community, there is no project.

- Become the best Open Source Web Application Scanner

- Right now there is some controversy on which is the best Open Source Web
  Application Scanner. One of our main short term goals is to become, without
  a doubt, the best Open Source Web Application Scanner.

- Become the best Open Source Web Application Exploitation Framework

One of the advantages of being the first Web Application Exploitation Framework
is that you are the best "by default", but the w3af community doesn't have to
forget about Metasploit.

H D Moore and his crew are building a lot of Web Application exploits, and the
architecture to support them. Our goal has to be to develop a stable
architecture to support all the exploit types and techniques that could appear
in the future.


Long term objectives (our dreams and hopes)
===========================================

The project's long term objectives to be achieved in the projects lifetime are:

- Create the biggest community of Web Application Hackers
- Become the best Web Application Scanner
- Become the best Web Application Exploitation Framework
- Combine static code analysis and black box testing into one framework
- Become the nmap for the Web
