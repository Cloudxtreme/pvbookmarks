PERSEUS library is an open source technology whose aim is to secure
any kind of communication streams against illegitimate or abusive
eavesdropping except for Nation State Security offices, provided that
a suitable, huge computing power is used (from tens of hours with a
supercomputer).

PERSEUS enables to provide at the same time users' needs for privacy
and confidentiality while preserving the ability of security agencies
(police, defense, national security...) to eavesdrop communications of
really bad actors (terrorists, child pornographs...).

The PERSEUS technology can be very useful in different cases:

- To protect against illegal or abusive eavesdropping activity by malware
  on a large scale (e.g. botnets which are listening on non standard TCP
  ports rather than hooking keyboards for example; hooking techniques are
  indeed supposed to be detected by antivirus software).
- To protect against private stream eavesdropping by private intelligence
  companies (consuming behaviour analysis, economic intelligence, non legal
  eavesdropping...).
- To protect communications from "non democratic" states towards democratic
  states (e.g; journalists).
- To protect professionnal of business communications in countries where
  cryptography use is limited or forbidden.

The interest of the PERSEUS technology lies also in the fact that TRANSEC
aspect is also provided (protecting the communication channel).

In other words, any data stream protected with PERSEUS looks like a lot of
legitimate, unencrypted data streams.

Moreover, its statistical profile is constantly changing (statistical mutation).

PERSEUS technology has been developped by Eric Filiol.
Current applications and implementations of PERSEUS library are:

- Eddy Deligne has implemented the first application dedicated to the HTTP
  stream through a Linux/Windows Firefox module (the sever is also
  available). See the Google code repository.
- Fabien Jobin has designed the Andromede library embedding the
  PERSEUS library to protect torrent protocols (soon available).

PERSEUS technology is an open source technology under the triple
GPL/LGPL/MPL licence.

The industrial support is provided by DFT-Technology.
