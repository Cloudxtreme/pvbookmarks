Introduction
============

``Xming`` is an X11 display server for Microsoft Windows operating systems, 
including Windows XP or later


Xming X Server
==============

Xming is the leading X Window System Server for Microsoft Windows®. 

It is fully featured, lean, fast, simple to install and because it is standalone 
native Windows, easily made portable (not needing a machine-specific installation 
or access to the Windows registry).

Xming is totally secure when used with SSH and optionally includes an enhanced 
PuTTY Link SSH client and a portable PuTTY replacement package. 

Xming installers include executable code, and libraries, only built by 
Colin Harrison (Project Xming's chief developer).


Features
=========

Xming provides the X Window System display server, a set of traditional sample 
X applications and tools, and a set of fonts. 

It features support of several languages and has Mesa 3D, OpenGL, and GLX 3D 
graphics extensions capabilities.

The Xming X server is based on Cygwin/X, the X.Org Server. 

It is cross-compiled on Linux with the MinGW compiler suite and the 
Pthreads-Win32 multi-threading library. 

Xming runs natively on Windows and does not need any third-party emulation 
software.

Xming may be used with implementations of Secure Shell (SSH) to securely 
forward X11 sessions from other computers. 

It supports PuTTY and ssh.exe, and comes with a version of PuTTY's plink.exe. 

The Xming project also offers a portable version of PuTTY.

The software has been recommended by authors of books on free software when a 
free X server is needed, and described as simple and easier to install though 
less configurable than other popular free choices like Cygwin/X.
