Description
===========

``GnuPG`` is the world's privacy protector. It guards emails, files, and apps from 
snooping and spying. 

The new GnuPG website will bring bullet-proof privacy to the general public, 
provide a friendly face of Free Software cryptography, and allow the project to 
sustainably fund maintenance and development into the future. 

The new GnuPG.org will be mobile and desktop ready with a fresh design, built 
for internationalisation, provide non-technical guidance for new users, and 
have built in management for future subscription donations.

Why this is important
======================

Recent government spying revelations have shown us how hard real privacy is to 
achieve, and how little of our information is really safe. 

**GnuPG is one of the few tools that can offer real protection**. 

Yet it remains popular primarily in only hi-tech circles, despite it's availability 
on Windows, Mac, and Gnu Linux, its ease of use, and the fact it's free of charge. 

We need to introduce new people to GnuPG and help them to start emailing safely 
and privately - the new GnuPG website will play an key role in making strong 
crypto desirable and accessible.


Why is strong privacy so important ?
=====================================

Faith in the privacy of our communications is necessary for:

- Guarding trade secrets
- Meaningful and fair negotiations
- Protection and advancement of human rights
- Academic exploration and development
- Political freedom and democracy
- Proper development from to adulthood - childish mistakes belong in the past


What makes GnuPG so secure ?
============================

It's Free Software - anyone can inspect its source code and check for back doors, 
and security experts frequently do. It's made by leading experts who were originally 
chosen by the German Government for their aptitude. 

It's build on rock solid cryptography principles that have been adopted industry-wide, 
and uses the OpenPGP Open Standard for compatiblity with other applications. 

It's so widely used that hundreds of companies have a vested interest in checking 
that it works the way it should. 

Unfortunately that doesn't mean they choose to donate to the project or support 
it in other ways. And it's even used by Phil Zimmerman, father of strong email 
and voice over IP encryption.


What difference will a new website make ?
=========================================

The existing GnuPG website dates back to 2002. 

It was built to provide easy access to technical documentation about the project. 
In 2013 GnuPG is now well accepted by technical security groups however, and we 
need to reach out to new audiences. 
We also need to make it easy for people to help sustain work on GnuPG into the 
future, by supporting subscriptions and encouraging donations.

Non-technical need encouragement to get over the few initial steps that setting 
up strong encryption takes. Faith in the relevance, usefulness, and power 
of GnuPG is affected by the the project homepage, and we need a new professional 
face to inspire a new generation of users to try it out, together with friendly 
introductions and pointers to additional resources.

A new website serves not only to boost the project's image and popularity short 
term therefore - it will found a sustainable development model for future 
maintenance and development of this foundation stone of digital security.
