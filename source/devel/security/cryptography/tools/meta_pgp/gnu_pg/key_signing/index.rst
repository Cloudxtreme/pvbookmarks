In cryptography, the Zimmermann–Sassaman key-signing protocol is a protocol to 
speed up the public key fingerprint verification part of a key signing party. 

It requires some work before the event.

The protocol was invented during a key signing party with Len Sassaman, 
Werner Koch, Phil Zimmermann, and others.
