========================================
Gpg4usb 0.3.3  (2014-01-03)
========================================


``gpg4usb-0.3.3`` fixes a bug which made private key export impossible, when 
``gpg4usb`` was started from a path containing non ascii characters

This release contains greek translation, thanks a lot to George

The ``gpg.conf`` was modified according to the `Apache gnupg recommandations`_ to avoid 
the use of sha1

We have bundled gnupg 1.4.16 with release 0.3.2-1. 

This gnupg version fixes a DoS Bug, see announcement 0.4.15_, and also an interesting 
attack, which allowed to sniff a private key with a mobilephone ;-) look at 
announcement 0.4.16_
