Welcome to the gpg4usb project
===============================

gpg4usb is a very easy to use and small portable editor to encrypt and decrypt 
any text-message or -file you want.

Our aim is, to give anyone the possibility to send and receive secure encrypted 
messages anywhere - on any computer out there, no matter if Microsoft Windows(TM) 
or Linux is running on it. 

**Therefore it's usage is self-describing, and the user-interface as simple as 
possible**.

gpg4usb is free software, and it is licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPL).

If you want to give it a try, please get our latest release here or visit our 
download section, get the files and unzip it onto your usb-pendrive... 

et voilà: you're done and ready to go!
