About Gpg4win
==============

Gpg4win (GNU Privacy Guard for Windows) is encryption software for files 
and emails.


What is Gpg4win ?
==================

Gpg4win enables users to securely transport emails and files with the help of 
encryption and digital signatures. 

**Encryption** protects the contents against an unwanted party reading it. 

**Digital signatures** make sure that it was not modified and comes from a specific 
sender.

and is the official GnuPG distribution for Windows. 

It is maintained by the developers of GnuPG. Gpg4win and the software included
