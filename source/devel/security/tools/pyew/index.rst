Pyew is a (command line) python tool like radare_ and iew oriented, mainly, to
analyze malware.

It does have support for hexadecimal viewing, disassembly (Intel 16, 32 and 64 bits),
PE and ELF file formats (it does code analysis the right way), following direct
call/jmp instructions, OLE2 format, PDF format (limited) and more.

It also supports plugins to add more features to the tool.
