Introduction
============
   
A computer worm is a self-replicating malware computer program, which uses a
computer network to send copies of itself to other nodes (computers on the
network) and it may do so without any user intervention. This is due to security
shortcomings on the target computer. Unlike a computer virus, it does not need
to attach itself to an existing program. Worms almost always cause at least some
harm to the network, even if only by consuming bandwidth, whereas viruses almost
always corrupt or modify files on a targeted computer.
