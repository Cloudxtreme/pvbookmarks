Compiling Shotwell with Faces support in Ubuntu 12.10
======================================================

Since my last contribution to Shotwell in September, I've been seeing some interest
about compiling Shotwell with Face Recognition and some variants of that same goal.

Anyway, I've got a little free time and I've decided to try to compile Shotwell
in a freshly installed Ubuntu 12.10 system with Faces tool.

But, first of all, let me say that this tool is in a development status, so it
is incomplete, e.g. there is no face recognition feature yet, only face detection,
and could be not so stable. You can and should make a copy of your Shotwell database
just in case running this version of Shotwell hurts it.
