``Authentication`` (from Greek: αὐθεντικός; real or genuine, from αὐθέντης authentes;
author) is the act of confirming the truth of an attribute of a datum or entity.

This might involve confirming the identity of a person, tracing the origins of
an artifact, ensuring that a product is what its packaging and labeling claims
to be, or assuring that a computer program is a trusted one.
