DigitalPersona also announced that a FingerJetFX version of FingerJet OEM's
central feature extractor function (see above) is now available as a free,
open source FingerJetFX, Open Source Edition (OSE) release under the Lesser
GNU Public License (LGPL). FingerJetFX OSE is similarly compliant with the
MINEX Outgoing Test, and compatible with the same operating systems, including
Linux, Android, Windows, and Windows CE.

According to DigitalPersona, FingerJetFX OSE can extract fingerprint minutiae
from an image in 10-25 milliseconds on an Intel Core i7. The company is also
offering a commercially-licensed FingerJetFX version of the extactor that is
said to offer fingerprint matching for both identification and verification
while still running in a small amount of memory.

Stated Jim Fulton, vice president of DigitalPersona, "Hardware and software
developers have historically had to trade off size, speed, reliability and
support for standards when choosing fingerprint recognition software to embed
into their products. FingerJet OEM frees device manufacturers and system
integrators from having to make compromises."
