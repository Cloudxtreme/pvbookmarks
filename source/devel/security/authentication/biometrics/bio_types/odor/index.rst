Description
===========

Researchers at the Polytechnic University of Madrid are exploring a new form of 
biometric authentication - body odor.

Turns out your smell - which may be just as offensive as the next guy's - is at 
least unique.

To prove that point, one only need to think of bloodhounds that can track people 
by following their scent. 

The researchers, however, admit that the technology they are experimenting with 
is not on par with traditional four-legged sensors.
