Description
============


Biometrics (or biometric authentication) consists of methods for
uniquely recognizing humans based upon one or more intrinsic physical or
behavioral traits. In computer science, in particular, biometrics is used as a
form of identity access management and access control.

It is also used to identify individuals in groups that are under surveillance.
