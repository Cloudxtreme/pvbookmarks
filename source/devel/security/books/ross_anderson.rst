I'm incredibly impressed that one person could produce such a thorough
coverage. 

Moreover, you make the stuff easy and enjoyable to read. 

I find it just as entertaining — and far more useful — than novels 
(and my normal science fiction). When I first got it in the mail, I 
said to myself "I'm never going to read all of that." 

But once I started reading I just kept going and going. 

Fantastic: well done. Now, let's hope that all those in charge of 
security for information technology will also read the book and 
heed the lessons.
