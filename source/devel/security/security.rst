Computer security is a branch of computer technology known as information
security as applied to computers  and networks. The objective of computer
security includes protection of information and property from theft,
corruption, or natural disaster, while allowing the information and property
to remain accessible and productive to its intended users.

The term computer system security means the collective processes and
mechanisms by which sensitive and valuable information and services are
protected from publication, tampering or collapse by unauthorized
activities or untrustworthy individuals and unplanned events respectively.
The strategies and methodologies of computer security often differ from
most other computer technologies because of its somewhat eluding
objective of preventing unwanted computer behavior instead of enabling
wanted computer behavior.
