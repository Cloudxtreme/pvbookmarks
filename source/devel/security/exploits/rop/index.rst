Return of Programming Exploit
=============================

.. seealso::  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return-oriented_programming



Return-oriented programming is a computer security exploit technique in which
the attacker leverages control of the call stack to indirectly execute
cherry-picked machine instructions or groups of machine instructions
immediately prior to the return instruction in subroutines within the existing
program code, in a way similar to the execution of a threaded code interpreter.
