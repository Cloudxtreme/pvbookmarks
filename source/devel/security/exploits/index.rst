An exploit (from the same word in the French language, meaning "achievement", 
or "accomplishment") is a piece of software, a chunk of data, or sequence of 
commands that takes advantage of a bug, glitch or vulnerability in order to 
cause unintended or unanticipated behavior to occur on computer software, 
hardware, or something electronic (usually computerised). 

This frequently includes such things as gaining control of a computer system 
or allowing privilege escalation or a denial of service attack.
