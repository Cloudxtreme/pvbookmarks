A GUI for metasploit: Armitage
==============================

.. seealso:: http://www.fastandeasyhacking.com/manual


Armitage is a graphical cyber attack management tool for Metasploit that
visualizes your targets, recommends exploits, and exposes the advanced
capabilities of the framework.

Advanced users will find Armitage valuable for managing remote Metasploit
instances and collaboration. Armitage's red team collaboration features allow
your team to use the same sessions, share data, and communicate through one
Metasploit instance.

Armitage makes Metasploit usable for security practitioners who understand
hacking but don't use Metasploit every day. If you want to learn Metasploit
and grow into the advanced features, Armitage can help you.

Necessary Vocabulary
====================

To use Armitage, it helps to understand Metasploit. Here are a few things you
absolutely must know before continuing:

Metasploit is a console driven application. Anything you do in Armitage is
translated into a command Metasploit understands. You can bypass Armitage and
type commands yourself (covered later). If you're ever lost in a console, type
help and hit enter.

Metasploit presents its capabilities as modules. Every scanner, exploit, and
even payload is available as a module. If you're scanning a host, you use an
auxiliary module. Before launching a module, you must set one or more variables
to configure the module. The exploit process is similar. To launch an exploit,
you must choose an exploit module, set one or more variables, and launch it.

Armitage aims to make this process easier for you.

If you successfully exploit a host, you will have a session on that host.
Armitage knows how to interact with shell and Windows meterpreter sessions.

Meterpreter is an advanced agent that makes a lot of post-exploitation
functionality available to you. Armitage is built to take advantage of
Meterpreter. Working with Meterpreter is covered later.

The `Metasploit Unleashed course`_ maintained by the Offensive Security folks is
excellent. I recommend reading it before going further.
