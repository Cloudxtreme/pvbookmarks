Description
============

SCons is a computer software construction tool that automatically analyzes
source code file dependencies and operating system adaptation requirements
from a software project description and generates final binary executables
for installation on the target operating system platform. Its function is
analogous to the traditional GNU build system based on the make utility
and the autoconf tools.
