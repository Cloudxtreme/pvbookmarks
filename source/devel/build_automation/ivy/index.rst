What is Ivy ?
===============

Ivy is a tool for managing (recording, tracking, resolving and reporting) 
project dependencies. It is characterized by the following:

- flexibility and configurability - Ivy is essentially process agnostic and is 
  not tied to any methodology or structure. 
  Instead it provides the necessary flexibility and configurability to be 
  adapted to a broad range of dependency management and build processes.
- tight integration with Apache Ant - while available as a standalone tool, 
  Ivy works particularly well with Apache Ant providing a number of powerful 
  Ant tasks ranging from dependency resolution to dependency reporting and 
  publication.

Ivy is open source and released under a very permissive Apache License.

Ivy has a lot of powerful Features, the most popular and useful being its flexibility, integration with ant, and its strong transitive dependencies management engine.
