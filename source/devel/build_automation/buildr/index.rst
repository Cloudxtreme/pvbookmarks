Apache Buildr is a build system for Java-based applications, including support 
for Scala, Groovy and a growing number of JVM languages and tools. We wanted 
something that’s simple and intuitive to use, so we only need to tell it what 
to do, and it takes care of the rest. But also something we can easily extend 
for those one-off tasks, with a language that’s a joy to use. And of course, 
we wanted it to be fast, reliable and have outstanding dependency management.
