JHBuild allows you to automatically download and compile “modules” (i.e. source
code packages). Modules are listed in “module set” files, which also include
dependency information so that JHBuild can discover what modules need to be
built and in what order.

JHBuild was originally written for building GNOME, but has since been extended
to be usable with other projects.
