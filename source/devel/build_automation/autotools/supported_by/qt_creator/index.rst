Introduction
============


After all the work, I can already announce and celebrate, that the plugin for
giving Qt Creator support for autotools projects, has been merged today into
Qt Creator !

I could not have finished my time at Openismus GmbH and series of posts related
to the plugin in a better way.

I am very happy of the result and hope it will be helpful for those who love
autotools.
