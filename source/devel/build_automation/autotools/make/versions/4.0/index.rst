Introduction
=============

The next stable version of GNU make, version 4.0, has been released and is 
available for download from http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/make/.

This version provides support for Guile integration as an embedded scripting 
language for makefiles, as well as other new features and many bug fixes and 
performance improvements. 

There are also some backward-incompatibilities.
