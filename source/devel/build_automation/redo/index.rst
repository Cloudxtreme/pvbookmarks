``redo`` is a competitor to the long-lived, but sadly imperfect, make program. 

There are many such competitors, because many people over the years have been 
dissatisfied with make's limitations. However, of all the replacements I've seen, 
only redo captures the essential simplicity and flexibility of make, while 
avoiding its flaws. 
To my great surprise, it manages to do this while being simultaneously simpler 
than make, more flexible than make, and more powerful than make.
