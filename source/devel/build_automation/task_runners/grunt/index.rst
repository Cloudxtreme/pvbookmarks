Why use a task runner ?
========================

In one word: automation. 

The less work you have to do when performing repetitive tasks like minification, 
compilation, unit testing, linting, etc, the easier your job becomes. 

After you've configured it, a task runner can do most of that mundane work for 
you—and your team—with basically zero effort.

   
Why use Grunt ?
================

The Grunt ecosystem is huge and it's growing every day. With literally hundreds 
of plugins to choose from, you can use Grunt to automate just about anything 
with a minimum of effort. 

If someone hasn't already built what you need, authoring and publishing your 
own Grunt plugin to npm is a breeze.
