Experimental support for the (also experimental) QBS build tool was added to
Qt Creator, and the binary packages now also contain it (in contrast to the
prereleases), though it is disabled by default.

To enable it, open “Help > About Plugins” (on Mac it’s in “Qt Creator > About Plugins”),
tick the QbsProjectManager, and restart Qt Creator, no further downloads/installations
are necessary.

The Qt Creator sources themselves also come with QBS project files, if you were
wondering which project you can open with it now
