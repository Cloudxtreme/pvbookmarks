What's new ?
============


This release adds some nice command-line usability features, with the ability 
to run a single test method and view task help from the command-line, along 
with some very useful improvements to progress reporting.

A new 'should run after' task ordering rule rounds out the task execution rules 
added over the last several Gradle releases. 

These rules give you fine-grained control when you need to influence task execution.

Work on support for native languages continues with more features 
for C and C++ development. 

This release sees the introduction of incremental compilation for C and C++, plus 
better integration with the Visual Studio and GCC tool chains.
