Description
===========


``Premake`` is a build configuration tool. 

Describe your C, C++, or C# software project using a simple, easy to read syntax 
and let Premake generate the project files for Visual Studio, GNU Make, Xcode, 
Code::Blocks, CodeLite, SharpDevelop, or MonoDevelop. 

Premake allows you to manage your project configuration in one place and still 
support different build systems. 

It allows you to generate project files for tools that you do not own. 

It saves the time that would otherwise be spent manually keeping several different 
toolsets in sync. 
And it provides an easy upgrade path as new versions of your favorite tools are 
released.
