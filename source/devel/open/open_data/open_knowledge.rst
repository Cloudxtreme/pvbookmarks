We’re a not-for-profit organization promoting open knowledge: that’s any 
kind of information – sonnets to statistics, genes to geodata – that can 
be freely used, reused, and redistributed. We promote open knowledge 
because of its potential to deliver far-reaching societal benefits.

We organize events like OKCon, run projects like Open Shakespeare, and 
develop tools like CKAN_ and KnowledgeForge_ to help people create, find 
and share open material. See our full list of events » and projects ».
