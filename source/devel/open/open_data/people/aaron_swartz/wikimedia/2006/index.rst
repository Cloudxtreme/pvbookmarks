Board elections/2006/Candidates/en
===================================

Since January, Wikipedia's traffic has more than doubled, and the pressure 
on the people behind it has grown accordingly. 

As a result, the Wikimedia Foundation is now at a turning point: it must 
go from a small group of people to a lasting organization. I am running 
to represent the community in this transition and to make sure we live 
up to our core values:

Collaboration
-------------

Our problems can't be solved by giving power to the right people, 
companies, or countries; instead, we will need everyone's contribution. 

Readers should be encouraged to become editors, editors should be 
encouraged to be policy people, policy people should be encouraged to 
help set the agenda for the Board. 

As a Board member, my job is representing the community: publishing 
details of what the Board is actually doing and soliciting the 
community's opinion about what it should be doing.

Innovation
----------

Software isn't neutral; its design shapes how you use it. Until now, 
we've been busy just keeping the software running. We must also work on 
improving it: getting more people involved, adding features the community 
wants, and making it easy for everyone to fully use. Since, in a very 
real way, the software controls the site, whoever controls the software 
has tremendous power. 

We must make sure the community, not private companies or individual 
people, decides how it develops.

Growth
------ 

Alexa reports that 5% of all Web surfers visit Wikipedia. On the one hand, 
that's pretty impressive. 

On the other, that means 95% do not. That's a lot of people to bring on 
board. But even of those who read Wikipedia, few really understand that 
they can write it, let alone do any of its other tasks. 

At the same time, though, what we've done is now a model to the world. 

Leaders in every field hope to apply Wikipedia's magic to their own tasks. 

Such jobs may require new organizations, new software, or new structures, 
but our grand goal remains the same: radical collaboration to give 
everyone unrestricted access to all the world's knowledge.

    Aaron was one of the early architects of CC. But his talent is much 
    more than technical. He is a brilliantly independent and clear thinker; 
    takes bullshit from no one; and has a deep and reflective view about 
    all things Net. 
    I’m sure this is true of more than one person, but he would make an 
    outstanding addition to the board.
