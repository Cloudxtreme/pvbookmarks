26-year old Aaron Swartz was an accomplished man — it’s not difficult to see his
influence on today’s web. He co-authored the specification for RSS 1.0 at age 14
and was a prominent internet activist throughout his life. Hacker News went
ablaze with comments of support for his work.

The Tech was informed of Swartz’s suicide by his uncle Michael Wolf and confirmed
the news with his lawyer early this morning. The Tech has covered Aaron Swartz’s
case since August 2011, and we’ve compiled our coverage below.

MuckRock has lost a beloved user, a mentor, and friend, and the world has lost
one of its great spirits with the death of Aaron Swartz.

He had the audacious beliefs that people should be able to read the laws that
governed them, that a government by the people and for the people should be held
accountable to the people, and that a robust public commons was a right, and not
a privilege to be revoked.

I love Aaron. I loved Aaron. There are no words to can contain love, to cloth it
in words is to kill it, to mummify it and hope that somewhere in the heart of a
reader, they have the strength and the magic to resurrect it. I can only say I
love him. That I will always love him, and that I known for years I would.

Aaron was a boy, not big, who cast a shadow across the world. But for me, he will
always be that person who made me love him. He was so frustrating, and we fought.

But we fought like what we were: two difficult people who couldn’t escape loving
each other.
