We share with you some unedited excerpts of Aaron’s insights, in which he
discusses growing up in the age of the Internet, the importance of the freedom
of speech and access to information, and how we as individuals are responsible
for the future of the Internet.

Rest in Peace, Aaron.

Our hearts go out to both Wally’s and Aaron’s families, and we are deeply
saddened by both losses. We have lost two tremendous men whose contributions to
the Internet and society have reshaped the social landscape.

They will be missed.
