Ever since then, I’ve realized that I need to spend my life working to fix the
shocking brokenness I’d discovered. And the best way to do that, I concluded,
was to try to share what I’d discovered with others. I couldn’t just tell them
it straight out, I knew, so I had to provide the hard evidence. So I started
working on a book to do just that. (I’m looking for people to help, if you’re
interested.)

It’s been two years now and my mind has settled down some. I’ve learned a bunch
more but, despite my best efforts, haven’t found any problems with this
frightening new world view. After all this time, I’m finally ready to talk
about what happened with some distance and I hope I’m now able to begin work
on my book in earnest.

It was a major change, but I wouldn’t give it up for anything.

The Chomsky Challenge
=====================

When I cite the work of Noam Chomsky, as I occasionally do, people often write
to inform me that Chomsky is a crazed liar, a fanatic, an America-hating monster.

This surprises me as I’ve read a bunch of Chomsky’s work and checked some of his
most surprising claims and he invariably comes across as a very scholarly
(sometimes to the point of absurdity) academic who typically presents a number
of facts and then suggests some conclusions that follow from them.

Since the things I learn from Chomsky are drawn from his collection of the facts,
the proper way to convince me that he’s wrong is to find a factual error in what
he’s said.

I hereby offer $50 to anyone who can find an uncorrected material factual error
in one of Chomsky’s published political works.
