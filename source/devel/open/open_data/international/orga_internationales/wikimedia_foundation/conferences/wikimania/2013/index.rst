Wikimania is the annual international conference of the Wikimedia movement.

It's organized by a different local team each year. In 2013 the conference is
taking place in the Hong Kong Polytechnic University. Wikimania allows the
community and the general public to learn about and share their experiences
with free knowledge initiatives all over the world.
