Présentation
============

Wikivoyage is a free web-based travel guide for both travel destinations and
travel topics written by volunteer authors.

The name is a portmanteu of the words “Wiki” (an Internet-based software system
that allows change and extension of the text by any user) and “Voyage”, the
French word for travel, journey, or trip.

The project was started when editors at the German and then Italian versions of
Wikitravel decided in September 2006 to move their editing activities and current
content to a new site, in accordance with the site license, a procedure known
as "forking". The resulting site went live as "Wikivoyage" on 10 December 2006
and was owned and operated by a German association set up for that purpose,
Wikivoyage e.V. (which currently continues to be its representative association).

Content was published under the copyleft license Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike.

In 2012, following a lengthy history of dissatisfaction with their existing host,[2]
the English-language version community of Wikitravel also decided as a community
to fork their project.

In a three way move, the English Wikitravel community re-merged with Wikivoyage
under the Wikivoyage brand, and also all Wikivoyage language versions moved their
operations to be hosted by the Wikimedia Foundation (WMF), a non-profit organization
which hosts several of the world's largest wiki based communities such as
Wikipedia.

Following agreements by the various communities involved and the Wikimedia Foundation,
the site was moved to the WMF servers in December 2012 and the entirety of
Wikivoyage was officially re-launched as a Wikimedia hosted project on January 15, 2013,
the day of the 12th anniversary of Wikipedia's launching.
