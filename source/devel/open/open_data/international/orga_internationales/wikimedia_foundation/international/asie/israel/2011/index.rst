Why ?
======

Once a year,

Hundreds of participants from around the globe,

Meet at the central conference of the Wikimedia movement

to create a world in which every single human being can freely share in 
the sum of all knowledge.

Wikimania 2011
==============

Wikimania is the annual international conference of the Wikimedia 
community. It's organized by a different local team each year – in 2011 
the conference was taking place in Haifa, Israel. 

Wikimania allows the community and the general public to learn about 
and share their experiences with free knowledge initiatives all over 
the world.

The previous conferences were held in Frankfurt, Germany (2005), Boston, 
USA (2006), Taipei, Taiwan (2007), Alexandria, Egypt (2008), 
Buenos Aires, Argentina (2009) and Gdańsk, Poland (2010).
