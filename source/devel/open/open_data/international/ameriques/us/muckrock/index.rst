    Transparency can be a powerful thing, but not in isolation. So, let’s stop passing
    the buck by saying our job is just to get the data out there and it’s other
    people’s job to figure out how to use it. Let’s decide that our job is to fight
    for good in the world. — Aaron Swartz


MuckRock has lost a beloved user, a mentor, and friend, and the world has lost
one of its great spirits with the death of Aaron Swartz. He had the audacious
beliefs that people should be able to read the laws that governed them, that a
government by the people and for the people should be held accountable to the
people, and that a robust public commons was a right,
and not a privilege to be revoked.
