Building a fact-based world view
================================

Gapminder is a non-profit foundation based in Stockholm. Our goal is to replace 
devastating myths with a fact-based world view. 

Our method is to make data easy to understand. We are dedicated to innovate and 
spread new methods to make global development understandable, free of charge, 
without advertising. 

We want to let teachers, journalists and everyone else continue to freely use 
our tools, videos and presentations.
