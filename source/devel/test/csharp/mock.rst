Introduction
============


Moq (pronounced "Mock-you" or just "Mock") is the only mocking library for .NET
developed from scratch to take full advantage of .NET 3.5 (i.e. Linq expression
trees) and C# 3.0 features (i.e. lambda expressions) that make it the most
productive, type-safe and refactoring-friendly mocking library available.

And it supports mocking interfaces as well as classes.

Its API is extremely simple and straightforward, and doesn't require any prior
knowledge or experience with mocking concepts.
