Introduction
============


NSubstitute is designed as a friendly substitute for .NET mocking libraries.

It is an attempt to satisfy our craving for a mocking library with a succinct
syntax that helps us keep the focus on the intention of our tests, rather than
on the configuration of our test doubles.

We've tried to make the most frequently required operations obvious and easy to
use, keeping less usual scenarios discoverable and accessible, and all the while
maintaining as much natural language as possible.

Perfect for those new to testing, and for others who would just like to to get
their tests written with less noise and fewer lambdas.
