Description
============
   
behave is behaviour-driven development, Python style.

Behavior-driven development (or BDD) is an agile software development technique 
that encourages collaboration between developers, QA and non-technical or 
business participants in a software project. 

We have a page further describing this philosophy.

behave uses tests written in a natural language style, backed up by Python code.
