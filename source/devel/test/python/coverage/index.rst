Introduction
============

Coverage.py is a tool for measuring code coverage of Python programs. 

It monitors your program, noting which parts of the code have been 
executed, then analyzes the source to identify code that could have 
been executed but was not.

Coverage measurement is typically used to gauge the effectiveness of 
tests. It can show which parts of your code are being exercised by tests, 
and which are not.

The latest version is coverage.py 3.6, released 5 January 2013. 

It is supported on Python versions 2.3 through 3.3, and PyPy 1.8.
