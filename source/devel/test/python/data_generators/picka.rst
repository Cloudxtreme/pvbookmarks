Introduction
=============


Picka generates randomized data either from lists of known good data (or bad)
stored in a sqlite database, or by generating randomized realistic data, using
string formatting (behind the scenes). Picka has a function for any field you
would need filled in. With selenium, something like would populate the
"field-name-here" box for you, 100 times with random names.
