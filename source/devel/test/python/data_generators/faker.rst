Description
============

Faker is a Python package that generates fake data for you. 

Whether you need to bootstrap your database, create good-looking XML documents, 
fill-in your persistence to stress test it, or anonymize data taken from a 
production service, Faker is for you.

Faker is heavily inspired by PHP's Faker, Perl's Data::Faker, and by ruby's Faker.

Basic Usage
=============

Install with pip::

    pip install fake-factory
