The exact migration date is not yet set.  

Google is organized around quarterly objectives, and so the people on 
the Infra team working on this project are aiming to have all of the 
prerequisites for the migration in place by the end of this quarter.  

chromium-dev@ will have at least 3-4 weeks notice prior to the 
migration occurring.  

We will pick a migration date in coordination with people involved in 
the release and trunk branching activity.  

We absolutely want to find a date that is out of the way of any 
sensitive processes, so we'll all do our best to find a date that 
is the least impacting.
