    Subject [ANNOUNCE] Git v1.8.0-rc0
    Date    Mon, 01 Oct 2012 15:44:56 -0700


A release candidate Git v1.8.0-rc0 is now available for testing at
the usual places.  There are a couple of leftover features we might
merge before the final release, but other than that, this is meant
to be more or less feature-complete preview of the upcoming 1.8.0.




Git v1.8.0 Release Notes (draft)
================================


Backward compatibility notes
----------------------------


In the next major release, we will change the behaviour of the "git
push" command.  When "git push [$there]" does not say what to push, we
have used the traditional "matching" semantics (all your branches were
sent to the remote as long as there already are branches of the same
name over there).  We will use the "simple" semantics, that pushes the
current branch to the branch with the same name only when the current
branch is set to integrate with that remote branch.  There is a user
preference configuration variable "push.default" to change this, and
"git push" will warn about the upcoming change until you set this
variable.


Foreign Interface
=================

- "git svn" has been updated to work with SVN 1.7.
