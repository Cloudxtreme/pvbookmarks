The ØMQ Community uses the git version control system, and the GitHub cloud for 
its repositories.

The ØMQ Community consists of a number of projects, each with its own public 
git repository, or "git". 

Each git has an owner or owners (with admin rights), contributors 
(with read/write rights), and users (with read access). 

Each project organizes its git as it wishes. A project is "official" when it 
is held under the zeromq organisation at GitHub, otherwise it is "unofficial". 

To make your project "official", discuss on the mailing list. The zeromq 
organisation owners group have the privileges to create new projects.

We use github's `pull request`_ model for changes. To make a change you fork 
the git in question, make and test your changes, and then make a pull request. 

The benefit of a pull request is that it is trackable, like an issue. 

Pull requests only work from a fork back to the original project.
