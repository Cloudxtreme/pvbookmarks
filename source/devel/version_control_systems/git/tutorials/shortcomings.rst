Unable to find a complete list of Git’s weaknesses, I have attempted to compile 
a list myself. 

Don’t get me wrong, I’m a proponent of Git (this site is on GitHub after all), 
but we must be truthful about Git’s limitations. 

This list (with a few exceptions) is about Git alone. 

I will avoid making comparisons to other version control systems unless relevant.
