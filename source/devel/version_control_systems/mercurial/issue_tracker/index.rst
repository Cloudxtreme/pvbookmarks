La nouvelle du passage à bugzilla
=================================

Hi, folks -

After many years of beloved service, the roundup-based bug tracker at
mercurial.selenic.com/bts has been retired.

The new bug tracker is a Bugzilla instance at http://bz.selenic.com/

All users, bugs and attachments have been migrated.

If you had an account on the old bug tracker, the email address you used to
sign up is your username.

Passwords could not be migrated - you'll need to select "forgot password" to
set up a new password.

You can change your login name afterwards if need be.

There's not a 1-1 mapping between old and new bug IDs, alas.
