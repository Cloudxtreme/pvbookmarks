Bitbucket is a web-based hosting service for projects that use either the
Mercurial or Git revision control systems.

Bitbucket offers both commercial plans and free accounts.

It offers free accounts with unlimited numbers of private repositories (which
can have up to five users in the case of free accounts) as of September 2010
Private repositories are not shown on profile pages - if a user has only private
repositories, the website will claim "This user has no repositories".

The service is written in Python.

It is similar to GitHub, which uses only Git. In a 2008 blog post, Bruce Eckel
compared Bitbucket favorably to Launchpad, which uses Bazaar.


History
========

Bitbucket was previously an independent startup. On September 29th, 2010,
Bitbucket was acquired by VC-funded Atlassian.

Initially, Bitbucket only offered hosting support for Mercurial projects.

**On October 3rd, 2011, Bitbucket officially announced support for Git hosting**
