Introduction to Bitbucket's REST APIs
=====================================

Bitbucket's REST APIs provide access to resources (data entities) via URI paths.

To use a REST API, your application will make an HTTP request and parse the
response.

By default, the response format is JSON. If you wish, you can request XML or
YAML instead of JSON.

Your methods will be the standard HTTP methods like GET, PUT, POST and DELETE.

Because the REST API is based on open standards, you can use any web development
language to access the API.

Bitbucket's APIs provide the following REST resources:

- Changesets

- Events
- Followers
- Groups
- Groups Privileges
- Invitations
- Issue Comments
