Some advices
============

Basic guide: http://mercurial.selenic.com/guide/

A guide on branching: http://stevelosh.com/blog/2009/08/a-guide-to-branching-in-mercurial/

I prefer:

- shelving for quick fixes, 
- anonymous branches for two-to-three changeset changes, 
- and cloning for anything bigger than that.
