Description
============

Branching offers a way to work on a new feature without affecting the main code 
line. 

You can branch on a local repository and make changes without ever making that 
branch visible in Bitbucket. 

Or you can push a branch up to Bitbucket so other repository users can access 
and work with your changes.

There are a number of ways to branch a repository this documentation only shows 
you the very basic ways to branch. 

Review your Git or Mercurial resources to get fancy with branching.
