A pull request has source code that comes from one repository (fork or branch) 
into another. 

When a pull request originates in a branch of your repository, it is commonly 
called "a pull across branches." You can incorporate a pull request into your 
repository using Bitbucket. 

You can also incorporate a request by pulling the code manually into your local 
repository and pushing the resulting repository back to Bitbucket.

If a pull request conflicts with your repository, you must manually pull the 
code to your local repository and resolve the request there. Y

ou resolve the conflicts locally by merging or whatever other means works best. 

Then, push the changes back to Bitbucket. 

After the push, Bitbucket shows the request as accepted. Pulling a request 
locally is also a means for evaluating a code change before accepting the change.
