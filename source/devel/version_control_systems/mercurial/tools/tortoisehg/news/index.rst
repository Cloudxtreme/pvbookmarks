There were a slew of last minute snafus, but the packages are now out
in the wild.  The website and wiki are updated and backups are
uploading to codeplex right now.   I probably won't upload packages to
sourceforge till tomorrow.

Thanks for all the hard work.

I'm going to be off-grid for about 4 hours, I have a hockey game to
attend.  If something comes up.. it'll have to wait :)
