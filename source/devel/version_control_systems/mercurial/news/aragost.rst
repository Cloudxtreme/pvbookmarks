============================================

Martin Geisler holds a PhD in Computer Science from the University of Aarhus,
Denmark. He has been involved in the Mercurial project for three years and is
now a member of the core developer team.

He relocated to Zurich in the beginning of 2010 to work full-time as a Mercurial
consultant for aragost Trifork.

This is a new blog centered around the Mercurial universe: we will review
new extensions, provide tips and tricks, show interesting workflows, and
generally do my best to keep you updated on the latest news about Mercurial.
