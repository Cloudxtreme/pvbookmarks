2011/03/10 appharbor now integrates with bitbucket
===================================================

A few weeks ago AppHarbor and Bitbucket met up for a few beers to see how we
could address requests from the community for Mercurial integration.

We’re happy to announce that AppHarbor now integrates with Bitbucket!

AppHarbor is a cloud service that competes with Microsoft Azure, a platform that
lets developers deploy their code directly from Visual Studio.

Every time you push to a Bitbucket repository, Bitbucket will notify AppHarbor
of the push. AppHarbor will then pull your code, build and deploy it.

In the coming weeks we’ll be working together to further improve the integration
between the two platforms.
