I don't think we have to ask them to do anything special, as long as
they can submit their contributions under the form of a patch.
Whether they use named branches, separate clones, mercurial queues, the
pbranch extension, or even the basic hg-as-an-svn-synonym workflow you
suggested should be none of our business, IMO.

A DVCS allows non-committers to manage (augment, fix, synchronize) their
patches more easily until they get committed. I don't think it will
change the committers' work a lot, though. I don't know how Mercurial
could make the task of committing an outsider's patch significantly
simpler.
