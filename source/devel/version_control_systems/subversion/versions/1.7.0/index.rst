Announce
========

I'm happy to announce the release of Apache Subversion 1.7.0. This is
a major new feature release of Subversion, containing many new
features, bugfixes and general usability improvements. The full
extent of the changes is too large to enumerate here, and I encourage
you to read the release notes (linked to below).
