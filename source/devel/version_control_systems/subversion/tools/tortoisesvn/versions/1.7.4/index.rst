Tortoisesvn 1.7.4
========================

.. seealso:: http://tortoisesvn.net/Changelog.txt


We're proud to announce that TortoiseSVN 1.7.3 has been released. It is linked
against Subversion 1.7.2

Due to some nasty bugs in TortoiseSVN 1.7.2 which in some specific situations
could make it crash, we're releasing this version out of sync with SVN releases.

TortoisePlink was also updated to Plink 0.62 which had a security issue fixed.

We recommend that you update to this version as soon as possible.
