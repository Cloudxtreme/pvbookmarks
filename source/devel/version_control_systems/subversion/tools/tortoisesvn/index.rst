TortoiseSVN is an easy-to-use SCM / source control software for Microsoft Windows
and possibly the best standalone Apache™ Subversion® client there is.

It is implemented as a Windows shell extension, which makes it integrate
seamlessly into the Windows explorer.

Since it's not an integration for a specific IDE you can use it with whatever
development tools you like.
