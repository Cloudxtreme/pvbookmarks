Description
============

``TurtleMine`` provides a plugin for Tortoise SVN/GIT/Hg for Redmine issue tracking.

Once this plugin is installed and configured you will have a new button in your 
TortoiseSVN/GIT/Hg commit window that will give you direct access to a list of 
Redmine issues that you can select to include in your commit message.

Additional features can be found in some of the sites wiki pages (see details below) 
or on the previous location for this project at: http://code.google.com/p/redmine-projects/.
