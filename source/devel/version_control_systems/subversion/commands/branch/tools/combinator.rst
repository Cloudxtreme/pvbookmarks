Combinator is a tool to help developers use and manage multiple branches of
software hosted in a Subversion (SVN from now on) repository.

If you are not familiar with branches and merging in SVN, I recommend you read
Chapter 4 of Version Control with Subversion at some point - it's not a pre-requisite
for using Combinator or reading this tutorial, but it definitely helps to have
an understanding of what's going on behind the scenes.
