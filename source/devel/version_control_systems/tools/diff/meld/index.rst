What is Meld ?
==============

Meld is a visual diff and merge tool targeted at developers.

Meld helps you compare files, directories, and version controlled projects.
It provides two- and three-way comparison of both files and directories, and has
support for many popular version control systems.

Meld helps you review code changes and understand patches. It might even help
you to figure out what is going on in that merge you keep avoiding.
