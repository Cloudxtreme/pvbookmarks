Introduction
=============
   
In software development, Travis CI is a hosted, distributed continuous 
integration service used to build and test projects hosted at GitHub. 

The software is also available as an open source download on Github, 
although its developers do not currently recommend it for on-premise 
use for closed projects.

It supports building software in numerous languages, including C, C++, 
Clojure, Erlang, Go, Groovy, Haskell, Java, JavaScript, Perl, PHP, Python, 
Ruby and Scala. 

Several high-profile open source projects are using it to run builds and 
tests on every commit, such as Plone, Ruby on Rails, Ruby, and Node.js.

In 2012 Travis CI launched a crowd funding campaign to fund further 
development which was sponsored by dozens of technology companies.
