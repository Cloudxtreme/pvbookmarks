Review Board is a powerful web-based code review tool that offers developers an
easy way to handle code reviews. It scales well from small projects to large
companies and offers a variety of tools to take much of the stress and time out
of the code review process.

For too long, code reviews have been too much of a chore. This is largely due
to the lack of quality tools available, leaving developers to resort to e-mail
and bug tracker-based solutions.

We've seen a lot of time and energy wasted doing code reviews both in open
source projects and at companies. In both cases, code reviews were typically
done over e-mail. A significant amount of time was spent in forming review
requests, switching between the diff and the e-mail, and trying to understand
what parts of the code the reviewer was referring to.

So in an effort to keep our sanity and improve the process both in our open
source projects and at companies, we wrote Review Board. We hope it will be
useful to your team too so you can focus on what's important: writing great
products.
