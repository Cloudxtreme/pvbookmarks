Introduction
============


This project shows how to create a somewhat substantial web application using
Django on Google App Engine.

In addition, I hope it will serve as a practical tool for the Python developer
community, and hopefully for other open source communities.

As I've learned over the last two years at Google, where I developed a similar
tool named Mondrian, proper code review habits can really improve the quality
of a code base, and good tools for code review will improve developers' life.

Some code in this project was derived from Mondrian, but this is not the full
Mondrian tool.

Source code has been published! See the Source tab above.
