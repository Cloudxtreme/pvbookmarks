Life of a Patch
===============

The Android Open Source Project (AOSP) uses a web-based code review tool known
as :ref:`Gerrit <gerrit>`.

The image below is a flowchart that details what happens to a patch, once it's
been written. Though it may appear complex, the majority of the steps below are
performed in the web application.

For full instructions on how to get set up to use :ref:`gerrit <gerrit>` and :ref:`git <git>`,
please see the `Submitting Patches page`_.
