Overview of the technical landscape

The servers, database, and tools related to the Qt Open Governance code
contribution process as well as their interactions are illustrated in the
adjacent picture. The process has been designed to provide increased
transparency and quick pass-through for code contributions, and its core is
the easy-to-use code review tool, Gerrit.

The tool is available for everybody, and besides using it for its main purpose
of contributors and feedback gathering, it can be utilized for studying the code
of the other contributors.
