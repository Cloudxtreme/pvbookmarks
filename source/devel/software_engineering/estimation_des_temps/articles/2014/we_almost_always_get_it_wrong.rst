Why are we so woefully poor at estimating software projects ?
==============================================================

Software developers are among the smartest people on the planet and often boast 
advanced degrees in mathematics, engineering, or computer science. 

In some ways, they are like superheroes â€” capable of programming complex 
functions, juggling myriad technologies, morphing customer ideas into working 
software, all the while not breaking a sweat. 

So how is it that despite such technical savvy and programming prowess, they 
are so woefully poor at project estimation? 

Study upon study cites that less than one-third of projects are delivered on 
time or on budget. 

Couple this with the fact that close to half of the effort spent doing 
software projects ends up being "rework" and the whole situation seems to 
defy logic. 

How can smart people produce dumb estimates ?
