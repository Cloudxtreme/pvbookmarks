JIRA (/ˈdʒɪərə/ jeer-ə) is a proprietary issue tracking product, developed
by Atlassian, commonly used for bug tracking, issue tracking, and
project management.

The product name, JIRA, is not an acronym but rather a truncation of "Gojira",
the Japanese name for Godzilla. It has been developed since 2004.
