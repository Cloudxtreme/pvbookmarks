Trac is an enhanced wiki and issue tracking system for software development
projects. Trac uses a minimalistic approach to web-based software project
management.
Our mission is to help developers write great software while staying out of
the way. Trac should impose as little as possible on a team's established
development process and policies.

It provides an interface to ​Subversion (or other version control systems),
an integrated Wiki and convenient reporting facilities.

Trac allows wiki markup in issue descriptions and commit messages, creating
links and seamless references between bugs, tasks, changesets, files and
wiki pages. A timeline shows all current and past project events in order,
making the acquisition of an overview of the project and tracking progress
very easy. The roadmap shows the road ahead, listing the upcoming milestones.
