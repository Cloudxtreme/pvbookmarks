============================================================

Signalé par BS (Bruno Simonet).

The freeware program SourceMonitor lets you see inside your software source code
to find out how much code you have and to identify the relative complexity of
your modules.
For example, you can use SourceMonitor to identify the code that is most likely
to contain defects and thus warrants formal review.
SourceMonitor, written in C++, runs through your code at high speed.
SourceMonitor provides the following:

- Collects metrics in a fast, single pass through source files.
- Measures metrics for source code written in C++, C, C#, VB.NET, Java, Delphi,
  Visual Basic (VB6) or HTML.
- Includes method and function level metrics for C++, C, C#, VB.NET, Java, and
  Delphi.
- Offers Modified Complexity metric option.
- Saves metrics in checkpoints for comparison during software development
  projects.
- Displays and prints metrics in tables and charts, including Kiviat diagrams.
- Operates within a standard Windows GUI or inside your scripts using XML
  command files.
- Exports metrics to XML or CSV (comma-separated-value) files for further
  processing with other tools.
