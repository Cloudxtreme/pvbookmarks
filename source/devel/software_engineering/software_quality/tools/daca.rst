Automated Code Analysis helps detect and fix bugs and other issues in source code.
The DACA project aims to give users easy access to a wide set of tools to improve
quality, while giving the tool's developers a test bed, more visibility, and
more feedback. Check the DACA (development) website_ and learn how to contribute
and `join the project`_.
