  In computer programming, lint was the name originally given to a particular
  program that flagged some suspicious and non-portable constructs (likely to be
  bugs) in C language source code. The term is now applied generically to tools
  that flag suspicious usage in software written in any computer language.
  The term lint-like behavior is sometimes applied to the process of flagging
  suspicious language usage. Lint-like tools generally perform static analysis
  of source code
