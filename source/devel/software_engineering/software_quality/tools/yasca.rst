Yasca is an open source program which looks for security vulnerabilities,
code-quality, performance, and conformance to best practices in program source
code. It leverages external open source programs, such as FindBugs, PMD, JLint,
JavaScript Lint, PHPLint, Cppcheck, ClamAV, Pixy, and RATS to scan specific
file types, and also contains many custom scanners developed for Yasca.
It is a command-line tool that generates reports in HTML, CSV, XML, MySQL,
SQLite, and other formats.
It is listed as a tool at the well-known OWASP security project, and also in a
government software security tools review at the Homeland Security web site.

Yasca introduction
++++++++++++++++++


Yasca is a source code analysis tool that I started writing in 2007. It could
best be described as a "glorified grep script" plus an aggregator of other
open-source tools. It isn't rocket science, but then again, neither is rocket
science.

Yasca can scan source code written in Java, C/C++, HTML, JavaScript, ASP,
ColdFusion, PHP, COBOL, .NET, and other languages. Yasca can integrate easily
with other tools, including:

- FindBugs
- PMD
- JLint
- JavaScript Lint
- PHPLint
- CppCheck
- ClamAV
- RATS
- Pixy

Yasca is designed to be very flexible and easy to extend. In fact, writing a new
rule is as easy as coming up with a regular expression, the file extensions it
applies to, and the name of your new rule. Place that information in a text file
in the plugin directory, and run Yasca!

Moose is a free and open source platform for software and data analysis built
in Pharo. Moose offers multiple services ranging from importing and parsing data,
to modeling, to measuring, querying, mining, and to building interactive and
visual analysis tools. Moose was born in a research context,[1] and it is
currently supported by several research groups throughout the world.
It is increasingly being adopted in industry.
