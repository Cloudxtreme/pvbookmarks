The PNG module has been designed to handle multiple sessions at one time,
to be easily modifiable, to be portable to the vast majority of
machines (ANSI, K&R, 16-, 32-, and 64-bit) available, and to be easy
to use.  The ultimate goal of libpng is to promote the acceptance of
the PNG file format in whatever way possible.  While there is still
work to be done (see the TODO file), libpng should cover the
majority of the needs of its users.

Libpng uses zlib for its compression and decompression of PNG files.
Further information about zlib, and the latest version of zlib, can
be found at the zlib home page, http://www.info-zip.org/pub/infozip/zlib/.
The zlib compression utility is a general purpose utility that is
useful for more than PNG files, and can be used without libpng.
See the documentation delivered with zlib for more details.
You can usually find the source files for the zlib utility wherever you
find the libpng source files.


About PNG, and the latest version of libpng, can be found at the PNG home
page, <http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/>.



PNG status

libpng is the official PNG reference library. It supports almost all
PNG features, is extensible, and has been extensively tested for over
14 years. The home site for development versions (i.e.,
may be buggy or subject to change or include experimental features) is
http://libpng.sourceforge.net/ and the place to go for questions about
the library is the png-mng-implement mailing list.


libpng is available as ANSI C (C89) source code and requires zlib 1.0.4
or later (1.2.3 recommended for performance and security reasons).
