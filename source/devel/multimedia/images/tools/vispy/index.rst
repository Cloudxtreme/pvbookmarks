Introduction
============   

Vispy is an OpenGL-based interactive visualization library in Python. 

Its goal is to make it easy to create beautiful and fast dynamic visualizations. 

For example, scientific plotting of tens of millions of points, interacting with 
complex polygonial models, and (dynamic) volume rendering. 

All thanks to the graphics card’s hardware acceleration.
