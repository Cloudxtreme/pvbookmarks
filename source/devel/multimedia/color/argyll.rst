ArgyllCMS is an ICC compatible color management system, available as Open Source
under the AGPL. It supports accurate ICC profile creation for scanners, cameras
and film recorders, and calibration and profiling of displays and RGB & CMYK
printers. Spectral sample data is supported, allowing a selection of illuminants
observer types, and paper fluorescent whitener additive compensation.

Profiles can also incorporate source specific gamut mappings for perceptual
and saturation intents. Gamut mapping and profile linking uses the CIECAM02
appearance model, a unique gamut mapping algorithm, and a wide selection of
rendering intents. Device Link can be created with a wide variety of advanced
options. It also includes code for the fastest portable 8 bit raster color
conversion engine available anywhere, as well as support for fast, fully
accurate 16 bit conversion. Device color gamuts can also be viewed and
compared using a VRML viewer. Comprehensive documentation is provided for each
utility, and a general guide to using the tools for typical color management
tasks is also available. A mailing list provides support for more advanced usage
