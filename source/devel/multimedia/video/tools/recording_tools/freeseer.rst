The Freeseer project is a powerful software suite for capturing or
streaming video.

It enables you to capture great presentations, demos, training material,
and other videos. It handles desktop screen-casting with ease.

It is one of a few such tools that can also record vga output or video
from external sources such as firewire, usb, s-video, or rca.

It is particularly good at handling very large conferences with hundreds
of talks and speakers using varied hardware and operating systems.

Freeseer itself can run on commodity hardware such as a laptop or desktop.
It is supported on Windows, and Linux, It will support MacOS soon.

Freeseer is written in Python, and uses Qt4 for its GUI. 

It also uses :ref:`Gstreamer <gstreamer_framework>` for video/audio processing.
