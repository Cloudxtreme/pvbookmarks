Project Description
===================

libCVD is a very portable and high performance C++ library for computer vision,
image, and video processing. The emphasis is on providing simple and efficient
image and video handling and high quality implementations of common low-level
image processing function.

The library is designed in a loosely-coupled manner, so that parts can be used
easily in isolation if the whole library is not required.

The video grabbing module provides a simple, uniform interface for videos from
a variety of sources (live and recorded) and allows easy access to the raw pixel
data.

Likewise, the image loading/saving module provides simple, uniform interfaces
for loading and saving images from bitmaps to 64 bit per channel RGBA images.

The image processing routines can be applied easily to images and video, and
accelerated versions exist for platforms supporting SSE.
