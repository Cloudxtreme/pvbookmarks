Wim Taymans has a computer science degree from Katholieke Universteit in Leuven,
Belgium and decades of software development experience. He co-founded the
GStreamer multimedia framework in 1999, and co-founded Collabora in 2007.

Today Wim focuses on maintaining and extending the core of GStreamer, both for
clients and as general research and development.


For those who don't know you, can you tell us a little about yourself ?
=======================================================================

Wim Taymans: I'm a Belgian living in Barcelona with my awesomest wife Maria and
my cute newborn son Ilian. I've been programming since an early age, first I
learned BASIC on ZX80, then later I wrote demos and games for Commodore 64 and
Amiga. We recently managed to release a new Commodore 64 game that I wrote with
a friend back in 1990, called Jim Slim.

I got involved with Linux at around 1998 when I cofounded a project to write a
video editor. We soon figured out that we needed a solid multimedia framework
for our needs. We started looking for available options and that's how I became
involved with GStreamer at around 1999.

For the last 3 years I have been working together with many of the other core
GStreamer developers at Collabora, providing development and design work for
customers using GStreamer all over the world.

The GStreamer 0.10.x series has been around since December 2005, which means
GStreamer has been able to stay API stable for about 6 years, what were the
major lessons learned from GStreamer 0.10?

Wim Taymans: It's indeed quite impressive how we managed to keep the API stable
that long without hitting a wall. A lot of thought went in into the 0.10 API and
we managed to assemble some of the brightest minds in one place to develop the
0.10 version.
