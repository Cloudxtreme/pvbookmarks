GStreamer is a pipeline-based multimedia framework written in the C programming
language with the type system based on GObject.

GStreamer allows a programmer to create a variety of media-handling components,
including simple audio playback, audio and video playback, recording, streaming
and editing. The pipeline design serves as a base to create many types of
multimedia applications such as video editors, streaming media broadcasters,
and media players.

Designed to be cross-platform, it is known to work on Linux (x86, PowerPC and ARM),
Solaris (Intel and SPARC) and OpenSolaris, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, Mac OS X,
Microsoft Windows and OS/400. GStreamer has bindings for programming-languages
like Python, Vala, C++, Perl, GNU Guile and Ruby. GStreamer is licensed under
the GNU Lesser General Public License.
