Introduction
============

Windows Media Video (WMV) is a video compression format for several proprietary
codecs developed by Microsoft.

The original video format, known as WMV, was originally designed for Internet
streaming applications, as a competitor to RealVideo.

The other formats, such as WMV Screen and WMV Image, cater for specialized content.

Through standardization from the Society of Motion Picture and Television
Engineers WMV 9 has gained adoption for physical-delivery formats such as HD DVD
and Blu-ray Disc.

History
========

In 2003, Microsoft drafted a video codec specification based on its WMV 9 codec
and submitted it to SMPTE for standardization.

The standard was officially approved in March 2006 as SMPTE 421M, better known
as VC-1, thus making the WMV 9 format an open standard. Since then, VC-1 has
become one of the three mandatory video formats for the Blu-ray format, along with:

- H.264
- and MPEG-2.


Video compression formats
==========================

Windows Media Video (WMV) is the most recognized video format within the WMV
family.

Usage of the term WMV often refers to the Microsoft Windows Media Video codec only.
Its main competitors are MPEG-4 AVC, AVS, RealVideo, and MPEG-4 ASP.

The first version of the codec, WMV 7, was introduced in 1999, and was built upon
Microsoft's implementation of MPEG-4 Part 2. Continued proprietary development
led to newer versions of the codec, but the bit stream syntax was not frozen
until WMV 9.


WMV 9
-----


While all versions of WMV support variable bit rate, average bit
rate, and constant bit rate, WMV 9 introduced several important features
including native support for interlaced video, non-square pixels, and frame
interpolation.

WMV 9 also introduced a new profile titled Windows Media Video 9
Professional, which is activated automatically whenever the video resolution
exceeds 300,000 pixels (e.g., 528x576, 640×480 or 768x432 and beyond) and the
bitrate 1000 kbit/s. It is targeted towards high-definition video content, at
resolutions such as 720p and 1080p.
