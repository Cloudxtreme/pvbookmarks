Introduction
============

FLAC (pron.: /ˈflæk/; Free Lossless Audio Codec) is a codec (compressor-decompressor
or coder-decoder) which allows digital audio to be losslessly compressed such
that file size is reduced without any information being lost. Digital audio
compressed by FLAC's algorithm can typically be reduced to 50–60% of its original
size, and decompressed into an identical copy of the original audio data.

FLAC is an open format with royalty-free licensing and a reference implementation
which is free software. FLAC has support for metadata tagging, album cover art,
and fast seeking.

Though FLAC cannot store floating-point data, and playback support in portable
audio devices and dedicated audio systems is limited compared to lossy formats
like MP3 or uncompressed PCM, FLAC is supported by more hardware devices than
competing lossless compressed formats like WavPack.
