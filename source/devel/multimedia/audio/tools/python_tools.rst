Python Audio Tools are a collection of audio handling programs which work from
the command line.

These include programs for CD extraction, track conversion  from one audio
format to another, track renaming and retagging, track  identification,
CD burning from tracks, and more.

Supports internationalized  track filenames and metadata using Unicode.

Works with high-definition, multi-channel audio as well as CD-quality.

Track conversion uses multiple CPUs or CPU cores if available to greatly speed
the transcoding process.

Track metadata can be retrieved from FreeDB, MusicBrainz or compatible servers.
