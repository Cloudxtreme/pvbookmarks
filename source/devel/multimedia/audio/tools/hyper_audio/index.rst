This project aims to show why free and open is the better way to go for audio,
radio and journalism, and to set the yardsticks first—by tinkering and exploring
on the edge of the possible. The term “Hyper Audio” draws inspiration from
`Tristan Nitot`_ who, after seing the first popcorn.js demo by `Brett Gaylor`_ and
developers from `Seneca College`_, coined the term `Hyper Video`_.

Since this is an offspring of Mozilla’s existing HTML5 video efforts, it seemed
appropriate to run with it.

The first demo with Tristan Nitot (the test page)
=================================================

- This HTML5 audio demo is brought to you by `Mozilla Drumbeat`_.
- It utilizes the `Popcorn.js framework`_ to dynamically display source data
  annotations as the audio plays.
- Player powered by `jPlayer.org`_.
- Follow `@moltke`_ to be the first to find out about more demos like this.

On-demand speech radio: disaggregation and transcripts
======================================================

I’m very excited to see a `test page`_ from Henrik Moltke which takes this idea one
step further, using the audio from DR’s Hard Drive radio programme. (You’ll need
a decent HTML5 browser, like Firefox v4, or Chrome).

This offers disaggregated audio and a transcript. It offers translation into
English from the slightly less accessible Danish.

Using HTML5, it also shows you the translation alongside the original language
as it plays. Highlight a part of the transcript, and you can tweet that part
automatically.

It’s a very impressive and strong example of what’s possible with new technologies.

Later: `Here’s how it was built`_ ; this is a Mozilla project using popcorn.js.
