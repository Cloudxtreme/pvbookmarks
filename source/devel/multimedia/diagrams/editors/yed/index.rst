Wikipedia definition
====================

yEd is a free of charge general-purpose diagramming program with a multi-document 
interface.

It is a cross-platform application written in Java that runs on Windows, Linux, 
Mac OS, and other platforms that support the JVM.

yEd can be used to draw many different types of diagrams, including flowcharts, 
network diagrams, UML diagrams, BPMN diagrams, mind maps, organization charts, 
and Entity Relationship diagrams. 

yEd also allows the use of custom vector and raster graphics as diagram elements.

yEd loads and saves diagrams from/to GraphML, an XML-based format. 

The application can print diagrams including very large diagrams that span 
multiple pages.

The name "yEd" stems from the concatenation of the letter "y" and the abbreviation "Ed", 
from editor. yEd is pronounced similarly to "Wyatt"[citation needed]

Introduction
=============

``yEd`` is a powerful desktop application that can be used to quickly and 
effectively generate **high-quality diagrams**. 

Create diagrams manually, or import your external data for analysis. 
Our automatic layout algorithms arrange even large data sets with just 
the press of a button. 

Ready-to-use Diagram Elements
------------------------------

``yEd`` comes with an extensive palette of beautiful, ready-to-use elements 
to get you started with your first diagrams, including:

- a wide variety of shape nodes and edge types
- group nodes that expand, collapse, and nest to tame large data sets
- UML elements for class and object diagrams
- swimlanes and table nodes to which other elements can be added or nested
- BPMN symbols for business process diagrams
- Entity Relationship symbols and crow's foot connections
- flowchart symbols
- people and computer network symbols

Technical Details
=================

yEd is a pure Java Swing application. It runs on all Windows, Unix/Linux, 
and Mac OS versions where a suitable Java Runtime Environment is available.

yEd is based on the yFiles for Java diagramming library, which provides 
not only the automatic layout algorithms and analysis tools, but also 
the intuitive user interface that makes creating and editing diagrams so easy.

For its look and feel, yEd makes use of UI components from JIDE Software.
