Pencil is a free application that allows anyone to design prototype or wireframe 
interfaces for websites, software applications, and mobile applications. 

Known as the Pencil Project, the application is considered freeware and is 
published under a creative commons license. 

Pencil comes in two forms: a plug-in for the Firefox 3 web browser and as a 
standalone application. 

While the plug-in form of Pencil can be convenient, it can be less responsive 
than running the standalone version. 

The standalone version is far more responsive and has better performance. 
This review covers the standalone version.

Currently the standalone version of Pencil is available for Windows and Linux. 

The most current version available for both formats is version 1.2. 

Pencil does a pretty good job with its core purpose: to design interface prototypes 
or wireframes. 
Many software developers and website designers use mockup and wireframe tools 
such as Balsamiq Mockups, Denim, Protoshare, and Caretta GUI Design Studio. 

All of these applications offer powerful features for a price. 
However, Pencil offers many the same options and features found these products 
without cost.
