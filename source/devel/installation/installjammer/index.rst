InstallJammer is a multiplatform GUI installer designed to be completely
cross-platform and function on Windows and most all versions of UNIX
with support for MacOS X coming soon.


InstallJammer features a very powerful install builder with support for
multiple themes and a high level of configurability for installers.
Installers are built as single executable files for easy distribution
over the web and handle installing everything you need for your
application in a simple, cross-platform way.


InstallJammer is written almost entirely in Tcl/Tk with a little bit of
help from some extensions written in C. Since all scripting in
InstallJammer is done through Tcl/Tk, it might be helpful for you to
learn a little about Tcl if you plan on doing any kind of complex operations
with your installer. Below are some links to get you started.
