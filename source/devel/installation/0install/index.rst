Introduction
============

The antidote to app-stores.

Imagine a world where:


- anyone can distribute software
  If you have a web-site, you can distribute your software;
  Create one package that works everywhere;
  With dependency handling and automatic updates;
  There is no central point of control


- security is central
  Users don't need administrator access just to install a word-processor;
  Digital signatures are always checked before new software is run;
  Users share libraries without having to trust each other;
  Use of sandboxes and virtualisation is routine


- you control your own computer
  You don't have to guess what happens during installation;
  Mix and match stable and experimental programs on a single system
