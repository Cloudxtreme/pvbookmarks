Announce
=========

We’re proud to announce that Qt 5.2 is now available. 

With the release of Qt 5.1 in July, we showcased the Qt for Android and iOS 
ports and laid down the beginning of some heavy improvements we have now done 
on Qt’s graphics capabilities. 

In the last 6 months, we’ve worked very hard to finalize this release and 
especially these ports.

Qt on Mobile Is Here with Great Opportunities
---------------------------------------------

I am proud to say that Qt 5.2 fully brings Qt into the mobile space as a true 
player in the app development market supporting:

- Android, 
- iOS, 
- BlackBerry, 
- Sailfish/Jolla 
- and Ubuntu Mobile. 

With this, Qt is the native cross-platform development framework with the 
broadest support of operating systems in the mobile space, complementing 
our even wider support of operating systems for desktop and embedded development. 

Qt 5.2 makes it very easy to take your existing desktop or embedded applications 
and bring it to mobile phones or tablets.

To show our commitment to being fully cross-platform also on mobile, we have 
an additional small christmas present for you. 

I am excited to announce that we now also have a Technology Preview of Qt for 
WinRT available. 

The preview is based on our development branch, and thus contains already a 
few of the new features to be found in Qt 5.3.
