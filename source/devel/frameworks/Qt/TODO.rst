Configuration
=============

http://live.gnome.org/dconf
    dconf is a low-level configuration system. Its main purpose is to provide a 
    backend to GSettings on platforms that don't already have configuration 
    storage systems.

    Mark then goes on to outline some of the challenges (e.g. system settings), 
    some of the solutions (e.g. Canonical are funding development from Ryan 
    Lortie to build dconf support into Qt), and he also discusses how Qt apps 
    should be welcome in the Ubuntu installation if they represent best-of-breed 
    for the Free Software desktop. I couldn’t agree more.

    Personally, I think this is a great step forward. I used to hack with Qt 
    many moons ago, and while I changed to use GTK as my preferred toolkit, 
    recent innovations in Qt (such as the incredible QML_) and it’s popularity 
    with developers, makes this not only a wise choice for app authors who want 
    to build Qt apps on Ubuntu, but also for Ubuntu users who will have a rich 
    set of Qt apps open to them. This doesn’t change our relationship with 
    GNOME or GTK, it is purely an additive decision, and I think it will serve 
    our users well.
