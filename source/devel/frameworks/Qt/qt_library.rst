The Qt project for library
===========================

Qt .pro file
============

The lib Template
-----------------

The lib template tells qmake to generate a Makefile that will build a library.
When using this template, in addition to the system variables mentioned above
for the app template the VERSION variable is supported. You should use these in
your .pro file to specify information about the library.

With the delivered Qt project we can test the certis2 bio API.
