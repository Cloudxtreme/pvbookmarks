Introduction
============


Necessitas_  is a community-driven lighthouse-based port of
Qt to Android [android.com].

It features the framework port but also a Qt Creator [developer.qt.nokia.com]
plugin for development and debugging.

There is also a installer application for Android called Ministro which does
the task of downloading the Qt libraries to your device and interacting with
a Qt application.

The project’s website is hosted at Sourceforge but development is done through
KDE’s servers.

The project follows Qt’s own license policy and strives to be upstreamed ASAP.
