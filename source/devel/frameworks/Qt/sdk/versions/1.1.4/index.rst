This 1.1.4 update of Qt SDK is very much focusing on bringing the SDK build
targets to the level of the latest Symbian devices and the Nokia N9.

It means that you can now start developing apps for these devices using:

- Qt 4.7.4 / Qt Quick 1.1 introducing among other things, right-to-left and
  pinch area support. These things are also supported by today’s Qt Quick
  Components 1.1 update. More about that and other features in Sami’s blog post.

- Qt Mobility 1.2 which introduces new NFC (near field communication) and
  Bluetooth APIs, as well as quality improvements to the existing APIs.
