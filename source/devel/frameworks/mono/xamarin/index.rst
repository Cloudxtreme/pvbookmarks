Introduction
============   

Xamarin offers two commercial products:

- MonoTouch 
- and Mono for Android, also 

known as Xamarin.iOS and Xamarin.Android, respectively. 


Theyâ€™re both built on top of :ref:`Mono <mono>`, an open-source version of the 
.NET Framework based on the published .NET ECMA standards. 

Mono has been around almost as long as the .NET framework itself, and runs on 
nearly every imaginable platform including Linux, Unix, FreeBSD, and Mac OSX.
