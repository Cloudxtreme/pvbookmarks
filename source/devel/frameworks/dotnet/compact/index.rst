Description
=========== 
 
The Microsoft .NET Compact Framework (.NET CF) is a version of the .NET Framework 
that is designed to run on resource constrained mobile/embedded devices such as 
personal digital assistants (PDAs), mobile phones, factory controllers, 
set-top boxes, etc. 

The .NET Compact Framework uses some of the same class libraries as the full 
.NET Framework and also a few libraries designed specifically for mobile devices 
such as **.NET Compact Framework controls**. 

However, the libraries are not exact copies of the .NET Framework; they are 
scaled down to use less space.
