Last week, Microsoft open sourced Roslyn, the .NET Compiler Platform for C# and VB.

Roslyn is an effort to create a new generation of compilers written in managed 
code. 

In addition to the standard batch compiler, it contains a compiler API that can 
be used by all kinds of tools that want to understand and manipulate C# source code.
