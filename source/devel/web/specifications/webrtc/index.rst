Introduction
============

WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication) is an API definition being drafted
by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) to enable browser to browser
applications for voice calling, video chat and P2P file sharing without
plugins.


Presentation
============

.. seealso:: https://fosdem.org/2013/schedule/event/webrtc_real_time_web_communication/

The WebRTC technologies have the potential to change how people
communicate on the web.

I will first give a quick overview of the building blocks behind WebRTC
(getUserMedia, PeerConnection), then explain how they work, show how the
APIs look, and give a demo of some possible use cases.

Mission

As defined in its charter, the mission of the Web Real-Time Communications
Working Group, created in May 2011, is to define client-side APIs to
