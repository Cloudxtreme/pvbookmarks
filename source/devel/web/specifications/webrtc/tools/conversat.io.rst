Introduction
============

WebRTC is awesome, but it’s a bit unapproachable. Last week, my colleagues and I
at &yet released a couple of tools we hope will help make it more tinkerable and
pose a real risk of actually being useful.

As a demo of these tools, we very quickly built a simple product called
conversat.io that lets you create free, multi-user video calls with no account
and no plugins, just by going to a url in a modern browser.

Anyone who visits that same URL joins the call.
