Abstract
========

The Resource Description Framework (RDF) is a general-purpose language for
representing information in the Web.

This document defines a textual syntax for RDF called Turtle that allows an RDF
graph to be completely written in a compact and natural text form, with
abbreviations for common usage patterns and datatypes.

Turtle provides levels of compatibility with the existing N-Triples format as
well as the triple pattern syntax of the SPARQL W3C Recommendation.
