Description
===========

X-Tag is a small JavaScript library, created and supported by Mozilla, that 
brings Web Components Custom Element capabilities to all modern browsers. 


Based on the current W3 Web Components draft, X-Tag enables the custom element 
portion of the proposal. 
Custom elements let you register new tags/elements with the parser, so they are 
recognized and inflated with special abilities you define.

You can find out more about what X-Tag does, where it works, and how to use it, 
on the project page: http://x-tags.org.
