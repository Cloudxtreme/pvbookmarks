Introduction
============

The acronym LAMP refers to first letters of the four components of a solution 
stack, composed entirely of free and open-source software, suitable for 
building high-availability heavy-duty dynamic web sites, and capable of 
serving tens of thousands of requests simultaneously.

The meaning of the LAMP acronym depends on which specific components are used as part of the actual bundle:

- Linux, the operating system (i.e. not just the Linux kernel, but also glibc 
  and some other essential components of an operating system);
- Apache HTTP Server, the web server;
- MySQL, MariaDB or MongoDB, the database management system;
- PHP, Perl, or Python, the scripting languages (respectively programming languages) 
  used for dynamic web pages and web development.
