Serve your python methods to several types of internet services at once.

Ladon is a framework for exposing python methods to several internet services
protocols.

Once a method is ladonized it is automatically served through all the interfaces
that your ladon installation contains.

Ladon is easily extendable.

Adding a new service interface is as easy as adding a single module containing
a class inheriting the BaseInterface class.
