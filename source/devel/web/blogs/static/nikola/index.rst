Why Static Websites ?
======================

Static websites are safer, use fewer resources, and avoid vendor and platform
lockin.

You can read more about this in the `Nikola Handbook`_.

What Can Nikola Do ?
====================


It has many features, but here are some of the nicer ones:

- Blogs, with tags, feeds, archives, comments, etc.
- Themable
- Fast builds, thanks to doit
- Flexible
- Small codebase (programmers can understand all of Nikola in a couple of hours)
- reStructuredText as input language
- Easy image galleries (just drop files in a folder!)
- Syntax highlighting for almost any programming language or markup
- Multilingual sites
- Doesn't reinvent wheels, leverages existing tools.
