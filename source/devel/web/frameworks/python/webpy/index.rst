Introduction
============

`web.py` is a web framework for Python that is as simple as it is powerful.

web.py is in the public domain; you can use it for whatever purpose with absolutely no restrictions.

The web.py Philosophy
=====================

The web.py slogan is: "Think about the ideal way to write a web app. Write the
code to make it happen."

This is literally how I developed web.py. I wrote a web application in Python
just imagining how I wanted the API to be.

It started with import web, of course, and then had a place to define URLs,
simple functions for GET and POST, a thing to deal with input variables and so on.

Once the code looked right to me, I did whatever it took to make it execute
without changing the application code -- the result was web.py.
