We (Audrey Roy and I) wrote a book on Django! It's called Two Scoops of Django:
Best Practices for Django 1.5, and you can buy it right now in e-book (PDF) form
on the website: http://django.2scoops.org.

Django, like any framework, has tips, tricks, and pitfalls that aren't documented
in one place.
Experienced developers know this stuff, but gleaning it off the Internet takes a
lot of time. We decided to take everything we know and write it down. This book
reflects a portion of what we documented, and if it does well we plan to follow
it up with other references.

If you've followed this blog or watched our talks you've know we've explained
tons of Django and Python related examples.

We enjoy using Django and Python to build stable, fast web applications quickly
and efficiently.

This is the book we would have wanted while learning the intricacies of our tools,
and then kept it handy for reference.
