ucomment is a Django application that allows for web-based commenting on a
document that has been written in reStructuredText.

ucomment relies heavily on Sphinx to typeset the document. A distributed version
control system is used to track document revisions and comments made by web users.

And it requires Django as the glue to hold it all together.

This entire site uses ucomment, so please visit the pages below to see it in
action.
