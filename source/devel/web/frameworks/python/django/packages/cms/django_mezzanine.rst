An open source content management platform built using the Django framework.


Mezzanine is a content management platform built using the Django framework.
It is BSD licensed and designed to provide both a consistent interface for
managing content, and a simple architecture that makes diving in and hacking
on the code as easy as possible.

Its goal is to resemble something like Wordpress, with an intuitive interface
for managing pages and blog posts.

Mezzanine takes a different approach from other Django applications in this
space like Pinax or Mingus that glue together a lot of reusable apps, instead
opting to provide most of its functionality included with the project by
default.
