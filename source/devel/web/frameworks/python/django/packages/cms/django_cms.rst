A Django application for managing hierarchical pages of content, possibly in
multiple languages and/or on multiple sites.

Django CMS handles the navigation rendering for you with clean, slug based
URLs, and this navigation can be extended by custom Django applications

You can define editable areas, called placeholders, in your templates
which you can fill with CMS plugins, by default we ship the following plugins:

- File
- Flash
- Google Map
- Link
- Picture
- HTML Snippet
- Teaser
- Text
- Video
- Twitter

However this is not the end of the list, there are many 3rd party plugins
already available for you to use. Should you be unable to find a suitable
plugin for you needs, writing your own is very simple.

    Apart from the other answer pulling in the big names just a few thoughts:

    * Django has an excellent security track record. I am not aware of any
     SQL injection.
    * Python won Tiobes lang of the year in 2010
     http://www.infoq.com/news/2011/01/python-tiobe-award
    * Django is built around concepts and patterns but still light weight
     and no over engineered crap.
    * Django is very modular. (ORM, Template eng., ...)
    * The Django devs listen to critics. Just mention that very funny
     djangocon key note by Carl Henderson
     http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6Fr65PFqfk
     And show how many of his complains got addressed. There was another
     Why I hate Django talk by Eric Florenzano that changed a few things
     as well.
    * Django-CMS is a healthy FOSS project. Show the commit history. Show
     how many folks are participating.
    * Django-CMS doesn't get in your way too much. I actually don't know
     many other CMSs. However, I had a go on this Typo3 config language...
     Further, it's so simple to create your own plugins / apps in
     Django-CMS. Not sure how to add that to your document you will
     probably present to some folks that have never written a single line
     of code.
    * The Django-CMS devs care about code quality. They test
     http://ci.django-cms.org/
     Same applies to Django of course.
    * Maybe don't show them the Backend of let's say Typo3 compared to
     Django-CMS ;) More stretch how easy it is to customise (You mentioned
     that already.)

    Well, there will be much more arguments ;) and much better ones.

    IMHO Python, Django and Django-CMS are great examples of FOSS projects.
    Just because software is free doesn't mean anything IMHO.
    I can't help you w/ the developer cost. If you optimise for the lowest
    price you will end up w/ crap and probably pay double (for cleaning up
    the mess the cheap one made).
    I got no clue about django-shop, just know LFS a little.

    my 2 cent,
