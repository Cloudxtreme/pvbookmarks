Introduction
============

Bottle is a fast and simple micro-framework for small web applications. 

It offers request dispatching (URL routing) with URL parameter support, 
templates, a built-in HTTP Server and adapters for many third party 
WSGI/HTTP-server and template engines - all in a single file and with 
no dependencies other than the Python Standard Library.
