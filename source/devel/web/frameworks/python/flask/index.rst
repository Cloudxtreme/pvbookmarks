Description
============

Flask is a lightweight web application framework written in Python and based on 
the Werkzeug WSGI toolkit and Jinja2 template engine. 

It is BSD licensed.

Flask is called a microframework because it keeps the core simple but extensible. 
There is no database abstraction layer, form validation, or any other components 
where third-party libraries already exist to provide common functionality. 

However, Flask supports extensions, which can add such functionality into an 
application as if it was implemented in Flask itself. 

There are extensions for object-relational mappers, form validation, upload 
handling, various open authentication technologies, and more.
