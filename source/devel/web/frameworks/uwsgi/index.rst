Introduction
============

The uWSGI project aims at developing a full stack for building hosting services.

Application servers (for various programming languages and protocols), proxies, 
process managers and monitors are all implemented using a common api and a common 
configuration style.

Thanks to its pluggable architecture it can be extended to support more platforms 
and languages.
