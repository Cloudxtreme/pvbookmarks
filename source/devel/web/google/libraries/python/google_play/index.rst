Introduction
=============

An unofficial Python API that let you search, browse and download Android apps 
from Google Play (formerly Android Market).

This library is inspired by those projects, working with the old version of the API:

* [Android Market Python API](https://github.com/liato/android-market-api-py)
* [Android Market Java API](http://code.google.com/p/android-market-api/)
