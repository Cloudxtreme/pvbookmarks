Introduction
=============


One web page for every book ever published. It's a lofty but achievable goal.

To build Open Library, we need hundreds of millions of book records, a wiki
interface, and lots of people who are willing to contribute their time and
effort to building the site.

To date, we have gathered over 20 million records from a variety of large catalogs
as well as single contributions, with more on the way.

Open Library is an open project: the software is open, the data are open, the
documentation is open, and we welcome your contribution.

Whether you fix a typo, add a book, or write a widget--it's all welcome.

We have a small team of fantastic programmers who have accomplished a lot, but
we can't do it alone!
