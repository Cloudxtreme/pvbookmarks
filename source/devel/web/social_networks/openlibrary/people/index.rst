The Open Library wouldn't exist without Aaron. He wrote the backbone of the
system you see today.

He has also worked on specs like RSS, startups like Reddit.com, and software
projects like web.py.

He worked from San Francisco to architect the site, put together the team, and
attempt to keep things organized, and we couldn't have come this far without his
crucial expertise.
