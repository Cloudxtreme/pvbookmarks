Extensions allow the addition of features through the installation of XPInstall
modules (known as "XPI" or "zippy" installation) via the add-ons website which
also features an update functionality to update the extensions.

An example of a popular extension is Lightning, which adds calendar functionality
to Thunderbird.

Thunderbird supports a variety of themes for changing its overall look and feel.
These packages of CSS and image files can be downloaded via the add-ons website
at Mozilla Add-ons
