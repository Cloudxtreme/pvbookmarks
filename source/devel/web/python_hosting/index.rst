An awesome year for Python web hosting
======================================

This year is shaping up to be an awesome year for Python web hosting.

Not only do we have existing reliable providers like WebFaction, but we now
also have a gaggle of Python specific web hosting services coming online.

So many that one can easily start loosing track of who they are. As such, doing
this post to list those that I know of.

Are there any more that people know of that are just starting up ?

epio
====

.. seealso:: http://www.ep.io/

This is ep.io, the hosted WSGI hosting and deployment solution. We take your
Django, Flask, Pylons or other WSGI code, run all the annoying hosting parts
for you, and make sure everything's redundant and backed up.

In return, we bill you only for the processing time and bandwidth you actually
use - we'll even give you detailed analytics of when and where those resources
are being used.

However, we're currently in a closed beta, so this is only available to those
we invite.

If you'd like an invite, fill out the form below; we'll send you an invitation
when we're ready for the next round of invites (usually a couple of weeks, March 2011).

In the meantime, feel free to have a look through our documentation and our
plans for pricing.


gondo
=====

.. seealso:: http://gondor.io/

Gondor is the production infrastructure that we at Eldarion have built for our
own sites and those of our clients.

We're making it available to other Django developers like you so you can focus
on your site, not your infrastructure.

It supports:

- revision control via git or mercurial
- dependency management using pip
- database migrations via South or nashvegas
- full backups of your entire application
- asynchronous and scheduled task execution
- full-text search using Solr and django-haystack
- caching via memcached or redis

compliant applications, including auto-configuration for Django, Flask and
Pylons, without the hassle of configuring and managing servers.
