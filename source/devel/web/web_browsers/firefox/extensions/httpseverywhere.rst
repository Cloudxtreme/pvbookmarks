Introduction
============

HTTPS Everywhere is a Firefox extension produced as a collaboration between

The Tor Project and the Electronic Frontier Foundation. It encrypts your
communications with a number of major websites. Many sites on the web offer
some limited support for encryption over HTTPS, but make it difficult to use.

For instance, they may default to unencrypted HTTP, or fill encrypted pages with
links that go back to the unencrypted site. The HTTPS Everywhere extension fixes
these problems by rewriting all requests to these sites to HTTPS. Firefox users
can get it by clicking here:
