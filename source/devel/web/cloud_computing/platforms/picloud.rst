Re-inventing the Cloud
======================

Leverage the power of the cloud with only 3 lines of code. Leave the load 
balancing, auto scaling, and server management to us.


Imagination at Work
===================

Our customers use us to crawl the web, process images and videos, calculate 
analytics, run simulations, and much more.


The Sky is the Limit
====================

Open network connections, use custom native libraries, and run your 
computation for as long as you need.


Pay as You Use
==============

No minimum fees. No server costs. We charge you for the exact time your 
functions take to run down to the millisecond.

PiCloud is a cloud-computing platform that integrates into the Python 
Programming Language. It enables you to leverage the computing power of 
Amazon Web Services without having to manage, maintain, or configure 
virtual servers.

When using this Python library known as cloud, PiCloud will integrate 
seamlessly into your existing code base. To offload the execution of a 
function to our servers, all you must do is pass your desired function 
into the cloud library. PiCloud will run the function on its high-performance 
cluster. As you run more functions, our cluster auto-scales to meet your 
computational needs.

Before using this package, you will need to sign up a PiCloud account.

The cloud library also features a simulator, which can be used without a 
PiCloud account. The simulator uses the multiprocessing library to create a 
stripped down version of the PiCloud service. This simulated service can 
then run jobs locally across all CPU cores.
