Introduction
============

RSS **Rich Site Summary** (originally RDF Site Summary, often dubbed Really 
Simple Syndication) is a family of web feed formats used to publish 
frequently updated works—such as blog entries, news headlines, audio, 
and video—in a standardized format.

An RSS document (which is called a "feed", "web feed",[3] or "channel") 
includes full or summarized text, plus metadata such as publishing dates 
and authorship.

RSS feeds benefit publishers by letting them syndicate content 
automatically. 

A standardized XML file format allows the information to be published 
once and viewed by many different programs. 

They benefit readers who want to subscribe to timely updates from favorite 
websites or to aggregate feeds from many sites into one place.
