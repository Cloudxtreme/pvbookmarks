Description
===========

On October 29, 2012, Microsoft released Windows Phone 8, a new generation of 
the operating system. 

Windows Phone 8 replaces its previously Windows CE-based architecture with one 
based on the Windows NT kernel with many components shared with Windows 8, 
allowing applications to be easily ported between the two platforms.
