Introduction
============

DiffPDF can compare two PDF files. It offers three comparison modes: Words,
Characters, and Appearance


Linux users probably don't have to built DiffPDF themselves (although doing so
is easy and gets you the most up-to-date version: see building).

For Debian, Fedora, and Ubuntu it is available as the binary ``diffpdf`` package,
so can be installed using the relevant package management tool
