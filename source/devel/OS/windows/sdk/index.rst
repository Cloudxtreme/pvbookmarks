Introduction
=============

The Windows Software Development Kit for Windows 8 (Windows SDK) contains 
headers, libraries, and a selection of tools that you can use when you 
create apps that run on Windows operating systems. 

You can use the Windows SDK, along with your chosen development environment, 
to write Windows Store apps (only on Windows 8) using web technologies 
(such as HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript), native (C++), and managed (C#, Visual Basic) code; 
desktop applications that use the native (Win32/COM) programming model; 
or desktop applications that use the managed (.NET Framework) programming model.

The Windows SDK also includes the Windows App Certification Kit (ACK) to 
test your app for the Windows 8 Certification Program and the Windows 7 
Logo Program. 

If you also want to test your app on Windows RT, use the Windows App 
Certification Kit for Windows RT.

The Windows SDK no longer ships with a complete command-line build 
environment. You must install a compiler and build environment separately. 

If you require a complete development environment that includes compilers 
and a build environment, you can download Visual Studio 2012 Express,
which includes the appropriate components of the Windows SDK.
