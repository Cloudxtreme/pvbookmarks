Introduction
============


This section describes how to perform basic debugging tasks using the 
Microsoft Console Debugger (CDB) and Microsoft NT Symbolic Debugger (NTSD).

CDB and NTSD are identical in every way, except that NTSD spawns a new 
text window when it is started, whereas CDB inherits the Command Prompt 
window from which it was invoked. 

The instructions in this section are given for CDB, but they work equally 
well for NTSD. For a discussion of when to use CDB or NTSD, see `Debugging Environments <http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/hh406268(v=vs.85).aspx>`_.
