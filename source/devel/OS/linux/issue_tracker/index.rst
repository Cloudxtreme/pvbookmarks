This is the Kernel Tracker system (based on Bugzilla) for posting bugs against
the mainline Linux kernels(not distribution kernels).

If you have problems or questions related to the Kernel Tracker itself, please
contact the bugme admin or submit a bug report against it.

You can find the answer to some of your questions in the FAQ page too.

All new categories are created owned by "virtual users".

You may also want to read the Kernel Bug Tracker User's Guide to find out more
about `Kernel Bug Tracker`_ and how to use it.
