Introduction
=============

Journalling Flash File System version 2 or JFFS2 is a log-structured file system
for use with flash memory devices.

It is the successor to JFFS.

JFFS2 has been included in the Linux kernel since the 2.4.10 (2001-09-23) release.

JFFS2 is also available for a few bootloaders, like Das U-Boot, Open Firmware,
the eCos RTOS and the RedBoot. Most prominently JFFS2 is used in OpenWrt.

At least four file systems have been developed as JFFS2 replacements:

- F2FS_,
- LogFS_,
- UBIFS_,
- YAFFS_.
