udev is the device manager for the Linux kernel. Primarily, it manages device
nodes in /dev. It is the successor of devfs and hotplug, which means that it
handles the /dev directory and all user space actions when adding/removing
devices, including firmware load.


Manual installation
===================


- download the archive under /tmp

- cd /tmp; unzip the archive

- ./autogen.sh


Architecture
============

The system is divided into three parts:

- The library libudev, that allows access to device information.
- The daemon udevd, in user space, that manages the virtual /dev.
- The administrative command udevadm for diagnostics.

The system gets calls from the kernel via netlink socket.

Earlier versions used hotplug, adding a link to themselves in
/etc/hotplug.d/default with this purpose.

Its goals are the following:

-  Run in userspace
-  Create a dynamic /dev.
-  Provide consistent device naming, if wanted.
-  Provide a userspace API to access info about current system devices.

The first item, “run in userspace,” is easily done by harnessing the fact that
/sbin/hotplug generates an event for every device that is added or removed from
the system, combined with the ability of sysfs to show all needed information
about all devices.

The rest of the goals enable the udev project to be split into three separate
subsystems:

1. namedev – handles all device naming
2. libsysfs – a standard library for accessing device information on the system.
3. udev – dynamic replacement for /dev


The udev program will be responsible for talking to both the namedev and
libsysfs libraries to accomplish the device naming policy that has been
specified.
The udev program is run whenever /sbin/hotplug is called by the kernel.
It does this by adding a symlink to itself in the /etc/hotplug.d/default
directory, which is searched by the /sbin/hotplug multiplexer script
