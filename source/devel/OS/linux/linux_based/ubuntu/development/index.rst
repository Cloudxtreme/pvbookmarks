In order to go from 20 million to 200 million users, we need to get more &
better apps on to Ubuntu. We want Ubuntu to have a full suite of first class
applications and to be a thriving market place for free and commercial
applications.

We believe a crucial element of this is to make the lives of application
developers more rich and satisfying.

This page is your starting point to find out about the work that's going on to
make this happen.

It's a bit rough and is definitely incomplete. You are welcome to join us in
improving it, or to follow along as we do so.
