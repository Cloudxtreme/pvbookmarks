=====================================

During the preparation of Fedora 16, the computing world lost one of its great
contributors: Dennis Ritchie. Ritchie co-invented Unix and the C language.

He also co-authored "The C Programming Language", a book that taught many
programmers just at the time personal computing was exploding. Without Ritchie
computing would be nothing like it is today.

A humble man, not well-known outside his field, Dennis will always be remembered
by those of us who practice the craft. Thank you Dennis.
