Buildroot is a set of Makefiles and patches that makes it easy to generate a
complete embedded Linux system.

Buildroot can generate any or all of a cross-compilation toolchain, a root filesystem,
a kernel image and a bootloader image.

Buildroot is useful mainly for people working with small or embedded systems,
using various CPU architectures (x86, ARM, MIPS, PowerPC, etc.) : it automates
the building process of your embedded system and eases the cross-compilation process.

We would like to thank Google, who will be providing the meeting location, with
Internet connection, but also free lunch and refreshments for the meeting participants.
Thanks Google!

It is worth noting that Google is sponsoring due to their usage of Buildroot to
build embedded Linux systems for embedded devices used in the Google Fiber project.
The source code of their modified Buildroot is available at 1_
