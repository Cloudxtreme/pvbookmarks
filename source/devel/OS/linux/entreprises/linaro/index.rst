What does Linaro do ?
=====================

Linaro is the place where engineers from the world's leading technology companies
define the future of Linux on ARM. The company is a not-for-profit engineering
organization with over 120 engineers working on consolidating and optimizing
open source software for the ARM architecture, including the GCC toolchain,
the Linux kernel, ARM power management, graphics and multimedia interfaces.

To ensure commercial quality software, Linaro's work includes comprehensive test
and validation on member hardware platforms.

The full scope of Linaro's engineering work is open to all online. Open engineering
has been practised from the start at Linaro with plans, specifications and progress
available for inspection on the `developer Wiki`_.

Linaro is distribution neutral: it wants to provide the best software foundations
to everyone, and to reduce non-differentiating and costly low level fragmentation.
