Introduction
============


Alan Cox (né en 1968) est l'un des programmeurs les plus impliqués dans le
développement du noyau Linux.


Retrait du noyau linux le 23 janvier 2013
==========================================


I'm leaving the Linux world and Intel for a bit for family reasons. I'm aware
that "family reasons" is usually management speak for "I think the boss is an
asshole" but I'd like to assure everyone that while I frequently think Linus is
an asshole (and therefore very good as kernel dictator) I am departing quite
genuinely for family reasons and not because I've fallen out with Linus or
Intel or anyone else.

Far from it I've had great fun working there.

Most of the people who should know more do, I know I've missed a few.

I may be back at some point in the future - who knows. In the mean time if you'd
like my job (or indeed one of a range of others) we're hiring 8)
