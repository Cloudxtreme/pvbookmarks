Introduction
============= 
 
Contiki is an open source operating system that runs on tiny low-power
microcontrollers and makes it possible to develop applications that
make efficient use of the hardware while providing standardized
low-power wireless communication for a range of hardware platforms.

Contiki is used in numerous commercial and non-commercial systems,
such as:

- city sound monitoring, 
- street lights, 
- networked electrical power meters, 
- industrial monitoring, 
- radiation monitoring,
- construction site monitoring, 
- alarm systems, 
- remote house monitoring,

and so on.


The History of Contiki
=======================

Contiki was born out of Adam Dunkels' desire to connect unexpected things 
to the Internet. 

In 2001, the open source uIP stack was developed as a smaller cousin to 
lwIP and quickly spread across the embedded world. But uIP wasn't just 
used in numerous deeply embedded systems, it also Internet-enabled some 
unexpected things. In 2003, Contiki followed suit.

In 2004, the concept of protothreads, which now forms the basis of 
Contiki's processes, was introduced in Contiki. Early versions of Cooja 
and the Rime stack were added with Contiki 2.0 in 2007. 

Power profiling was developed in 2007. Instant Contiki and the Coffee 
file system were introduced early 2008. 

Later in 2008, Cisco contributed the fully certified IPv6 stack to Contiki.

In 2009 and 2010, many new platforms were added to Contiki and new 
low-power mechanisms were developed. 2011 saw the addition of two important 
mechanisms: ContikiRPL, for IPv6 routing, and ContikiMAC for sleepy routers.

2012 marks a new beginning for Contiki.

The rest is history, in the making.
