Introduction
============

Oracle and Google are currently in a $1 billion wrestling match over 
Google’s use of Java in Android.

**But Java is not the only way to build native apps on Android**.

In fact, it’s not even the best way: we have been offering C# to Android
developers as a high-performance, low-battery consuming alternative to Java.

Our platform, Mono, is an open source implementation of the .NET framework 
that allows developers to write their code using C# while running on top 
of the Java-powered operating system, and then share that same code with 
iOS and Windows Phone.
