Introduction
============


You wanna start programming on Android but have no Java skills ? It's easy!

Just go to Google Play Market and install QPython on your device. 

**QPython is Python implementation for Android**. 

It is based on Scripting Layer for Android (SL4A), but as for me, it is a bit 
more comfortable.
