January 27, 2014 —  Windows developers looking to build Android apps can now 
do so in Visual Studio, thanks to the Android++ extension.

Justin Webb, lead Android programmer at NaturalMotion (a game company based in 
Oxford, England), created Android++ to give Android—the largest and fastest-growing 
mobile platform—access to Microsoft’s dedicated IDE and native source-level 
debugging to increase coherence in developing C/C++ applications.
