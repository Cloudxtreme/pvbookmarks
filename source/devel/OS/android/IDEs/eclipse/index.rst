Introduction
============

Setting Up the ADT Bundle

The ADT Bundle provides everything you need to start developing apps, including 
a version of the Eclipse IDE with built-in ADT (Android Developer Tools) to 
streamline your Android app development. 

If you haven't already, go download the Android ADT Bundle. (If you downloaded 
the SDK Tools only, for use with an existing IDE, you should instead read Setting 
Up an Existing IDE.)

Install the SDK and Eclipse IDE
--------------------------------

- Unpack the ZIP file (named adt-bundle-<os_platform>.zip) and save it to an appropriate location, such as a "Development" directory in your home directory.
- Open the adt-bundle-<os_platform>/eclipse/ directory and launch eclipse.

That's it! The IDE is already loaded with the Android Developer Tools plugin 
and the SDK is ready to go. 

To start developing, read Building Your First App.

.. warning:: Do not move any of the files or directories from the 
   adt-bundle-<os_platform> directory. If you move the eclipse or sdk directory, 
   ADT will not be able to locate the SDK and you'll need to manually update the ADT preferences.

Additional information
-----------------------

As you continue developing apps, you may need to install additional versions of 
Android for the emulator and other packages such as the library for Google 
Play In-app Billing. 
To install more packages, use the SDK Manager.

Everything you need to develop Android apps is on this web site, including 
design guidelines, developer training, API reference, and information about 
how you can distribute your app. 

For additional resources about developing and distributing your app, see the 
Developer Support Resources.
