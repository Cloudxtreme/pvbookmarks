What is it ?
============

Necessitas is a KDE community project aimed to provide an easy way to develop
Qt apps on Android platform.

The Qt framework is a great Development Framework ! It's multi-platform, complete,
mature and bleeding-edge at the same time.

With Qt you can write great applications for the desktop (Linux, Mac and Windows)
and for the mobile world (tablets, phones... Symbian, MeeGo, Maemo, Android,
BlackBerry, IOS, WebOS...) and also in the embedded world.

Qt is a C++ framework, which is a plus if you don't like Java that much.

Android... well, it does not need introductions. The Google powered mobile system,
based on Linux, it's both the most widespread and more open mobile environment
available today.

Necessitas comes from the need of exploting the power and the multi-platform
capabilities of the Qt framework on the Android world. It was born as a concept
work which demonstrates the flexibility of Qt and, today, strives to become a
fully working development solution for Android.
