.. versionadded:: 5.2
   Use Qt creator 3.0 for Android.


**The Qt for Android port is now fully supported and ready for production use.**


**Qt applications** can be run on devices with Android v2.3.3 (API level 10) or 
higher and deployed easily to Google Play.

The tools have been nicely integrated with Qt Creator 3.0 for a seamless 
workflow and Qt applications can be developed, built, packaged and deployed 
all directly from within Qt Creator.

Qt Webkit is not supported on Android and we are working on providing a 
cross-platform API to integrate web content into mobile apps. 
If you you would like to incorporate web content into your Qt application, 
you need to use a native web component. 
To make interacting with native contents easier, we are providing the 
`Qt Android Extras`_ module with a JNI_ convenience API.
