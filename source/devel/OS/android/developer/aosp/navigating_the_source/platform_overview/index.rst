Welcome to Android 4.2, the latest version of Jelly Bean !

Android 4.2 has performance optimizations, a refreshed system UI, and great new
features for users and developers.

This document provides a glimpse of what's new for developers

Android 4.1 ("Jelly Bean", API level 17)
=========================================

Android 4.1 corresponded to the "Jelly Bean" milestone branch, and has an API
level of 16.


Android 4.0 ("IceCreamSandwich", API level 14)
=================================================

corresponded to the "IceCreamSandwich" milestone branch, and has an API level of 14.

Android 2.3 ("Gingerbread", API level of 9, 10)
===============================================

Android 2.3 corresponded to the "Gingerbread" milestone branch, and has an
API level of 9. In versions 2.3.3 and higher, the API level is 10.

Android 2.2 ("Froyo, API level 8)
==================================

Android 2.2 corresponded to the "FroYo" milestone branch, and has an API level of 8.

Android 2.1
===========

Android 2.1 corresponded to the "Eclair" milestone branch, and has an API level of 7.

The Eclair branch was also used for 2.0 and 2.0.1; however, both of those releases
were quickly obsoleted by the version 2.1 Eclair release.

As Android 2.1 includes key bug fixes and improvements not present in 2.0/2.0.1,
only Android 2.1 should be used for new devices.
As there is no compatibility program for 2.0 or 2.0.1, the officially compatible
Eclair-based release is Android 2.1. (The linked document refers to Android 2.0,
because there were no new platform features added in 2.1.)

Android 1.6
===========

Android 1.6 corresponded to the "Donut" milestone branch, and has an API level of 4.

Android 1.5
===========

Android 1.5 corresponded to the "Cupcake" milestone branch, and has an API level of 3.


Android 1.1
============

Android 1.1 has an API level of 2.

Android 1.1 was known as "Petit Four" internally, though this name was not used
officially.

Android 1.0
===========

was the first release of Android, and has an API level of 1.

Since it was the first released version of Android, no platform highlights were
prepared for this release.
