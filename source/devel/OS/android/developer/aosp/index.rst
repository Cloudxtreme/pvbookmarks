We use the phrase ``Android Open Source Project`` or **AOSP** to refer to the people,
the processes, and the source code that make up Android.

The people oversee the project and develop the actual source code.

The processes refer to the tools and procedures we use to manage the development
of the software. The net result is the source code that you can use to build cell
phone and other devices.
