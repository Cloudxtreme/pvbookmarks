Introduction

   - https://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/bundle.html

The Android SDK provides you the API libraries and developer tools necessary to
build, test, and debug apps for Android.

If you're a new Android developer, we recommend you download the ADT Bundle to
quickly start developing apps.

It includes the essential Android SDK components and a version of the Eclipse
IDE with built-in ADT (Android Developer Tools) to streamline your Android app
development.

With a single download, the `ADT Bundle`_ includes everything you need to begin
developing apps:

- Eclipse + ADT plugin
- Android SDK Tools
- Android Platform-tools
- The latest Android platform
- The latest Android system image for the emulator


.. _`ADT Bundle`:   https://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/bundle.html

As you continue developing apps, you may need to install additional versions of
Android for the emulator and other packages such as the library for Google Play
In-app Billing. To install more packages, use the SDK Manager.
