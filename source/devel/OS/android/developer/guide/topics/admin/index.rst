Introduction
============

Android 2.2 introduces support for enterprise applications by offering the
Android Device Administration API.

The Device Administration API provides device administration features at the
system level. These APIs allow you to create security-aware applications that
are useful in enterprise settings, in which IT professionals require rich control
over employee devices.

For example, the built-in Android Email application has leveraged the new APIs
to improve Exchange support.

Through the Email application, Exchange administrators can enforce password
policies — including alphanumeric passwords or numeric PINs — across devices.

Administrators can also remotely wipe (that is, restore factory defaults on)
lost or stolen handsets.

Exchange users can sync their email and calendar data.
