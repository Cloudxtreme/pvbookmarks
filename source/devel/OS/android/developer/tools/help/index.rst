Tools
======

The Android SDK includes a variety of tools that help you develop mobile
applications for the Android platform.

The tools are classified into two groups:

- SDK tools
- and platform tools.

SDK tools are platform independent and are required no matter which Android
platform you are developing on.

Platform tools are customized to support the features of the latest Android
platform.



SDK Tools

The SDK tools are installed with the SDK starter package and are periodically
updated.
