Introduction
============

The Android SDK includes a virtual mobile device emulator that runs on your
computer.

**The emulator lets you prototype, develop and test Android applications without
using a physical device**.

The Android emulator mimics all of the hardware and software features of a typical
mobile device, except that it cannot place actual phone calls.

It provides a variety of navigation and control keys, which you can "press" using
your mouse or keyboard to generate events for your application.

It also provides a screen in which your application is displayed, together with
any other active Android applications.
