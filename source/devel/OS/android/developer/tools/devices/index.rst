An ``Android Virtual Device`` (**AVD**) is an **emulator** configuration that lets
you model an actual device by defining hardware and software options to be
emulated by the Android Emulator.

The easiest way to create an AVD is to use the graphical AVD Manager, which you
launch from Eclipse by clicking Window > AVD Manager.

You can also start the AVD Manager from the `command line`_ by calling the android
tool with the avd options, from the <sdk>/tools/ directory.
