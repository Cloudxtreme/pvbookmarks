Introduction
============

The Android framework includes an integrated testing framework that helps you test
all aspects of your application and the SDK tools include tools for setting up
and running test applications.

Whether you are working in Eclipse with ADT or working from the command line, the
SDK tools help you set up and run your tests within an emulator or the device
you are targeting.

If you aren't yet familiar with the Android testing framework, start by reading
`Testing Fundamentals`_.

For a step-by-step introduction to Android testing, try the `Activity Testing Tutorial`_.
