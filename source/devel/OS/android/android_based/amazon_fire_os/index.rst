Introduction
=============


Fire OS is a fork of the Android mobile operating system produced by Amazon for 
its Kindle Fire range of tablets. Fire OS primarily centers around content 
consumption, with a customized interface and heavy ties to content available 
from Amazon's own storefronts and services.

While the Kindle Fire line has always used customized distributions of Android, 
particularly 2.3.3, API level 10 (Kindle Fire) and 4.0.3, API level 15 (Kindle Fire HD), 
Amazon only began referring to the distribution as Fire OS beginning with its 
third iteration, introduced by the 3rd generation Kindle Fire HD and HDX models. 

Unlike previous Kindle Fire models, whose operating system is listed as being 
"based on" Android, their operating system is listed as being "Fire OS 3.0 
(compatible with Android 4.2.2, API level 17"
