Introduction
============

CyanogenMod (pronounced /saɪ.ˈæn.oʊ.ˌdʒɛn.mɒd/) is an open source replacement
firmware for smart phones and tablet computers based on the Android mobile
operating system.

It offers features and options not found in the official firmware distributed by
vendors of these devices.

Features supported by CyanogenMod include:

- native theming support,
- FLAC audio codec support,
- a large Access Point Name list,
- an OpenVPN client, an enhanced reboot menu,
- support for Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and USB tethering,
- CPU overclocking and other performance enhancements,
- soft buttons and other "tablet tweaks",
- toggles in the notification pull-down (such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and GPS),
- app permissions management, as well as other interface enhancements.

**According to its developers, CyanogenMod does not contain spyware or bloatware**.

CyanogenMod is also stated to increase performance and reliability compared with
official firmware releases.

CyanogenMod is developed as free and open source software based on the official
releases of Android by Google, with added original and third-party code.

Although only a subset of total CyanogenMod users elect to report their use of
the firmware, as of 6 April 2013, CyanogenMod has recorded over 4.1 million active
installs on a multitude of devices
