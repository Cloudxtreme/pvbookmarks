Interview with Jean J. Labrosse – Founder, CEO, and President at Micriµm 

This article describes how you can get started with learning about the 
internals of real-time kernels using a commercial grade kernel, running 
on actual hardware and using professional grade tools, all for next to nothing.

Jean Labrosse founded Micrium in 1999 and continues to maintain an active 
role in product development, ensuring that the company adheres to the 
strict policies and standards that make it strong. 

Labrosse is a regular speaker at the Embedded Systems Conference in Boston 
and Silicon Valley, and other industry conferences. 

He is the author of three definitive books on embedded design: 

- MicroC/OS-II The Real-Time Kernel, 
- Embedded Systems Building Blocks Complete and Ready-to-Use Modules in C, 
- and µC/OS-III, The Real-Time Kernel,

and has published numerous articles and appeared on industry panels on 
the subject of embedded design. 

He holds BSEE and MSEE degrees from the University of Sherbrooke, Quebec, Canada.
