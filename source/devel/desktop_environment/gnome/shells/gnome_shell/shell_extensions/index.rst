What is GNOME Shell ?
======================

GNOME Shell provides core user interface functions for GNOME, like switching
to windows and launching applications.

User interface elements provided by GNOME Shell include the Panel at the top
of the screen, the Activities Overview, and Message Tray at the bottom of the
screen.

What are GNOME Shell Extensions ?
==================================

GNOME Shell extensions are small pieces of code written by third party
developers that modify the way GNOME works. (If you are familiar with Chrome
Extensions or Firefox Addons, GNOME Shell extensions are similar to them.)

You can find and install GNOME Shell extensions using this website.

Since extensions are created outside of the normal GNOME design and development
process, they are supported by their authors, rather than by the GNOME community.

Some features first implemented as extensions might find their way into future
versions of GNOME.
