Cheese uses your webcam to take photos and videos, applies fancy special effects
and lets you share the fun with others.

It was written as part of Google's 2007 Summer of Code lead by daniel g. siegel
and mentored by Raphaël Slinckx.

Under the hood, Cheese uses GStreamer to apply fancy effects to photos and videos.

With Cheese it is easy to take photos of you, your friends, pets or whatever
you want and share them with others.

After a success of the Summer of Code, the development continued and we still
are looking for people with nice ideas and patches ;)
