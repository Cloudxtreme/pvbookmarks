Presentation
============

GNOME (pronounced /ˈnoʊm/ or /ɡəˈnoʊm/) is a desktop environment and graphical
user interface that runs on top of a computer operating system.

It is composed entirely of free and open source software.

It is an international project that includes creating software development
frameworks, selecting application software for the desktop, and working on
the programs that manage application launching, file handling, and window and
task management.

GNOME is part of the GNU Project and can be used with various Unix-like
operating systems, most notably Linux and as part of OpenSolaris Desktop.


Métaphore d’interface
=====================

La métaphore d'interface à la base de l'expérience utilisateur a radicalement
changé avec la version 3.0.

Précédemment l'environnement GNOME adoptait la métaphore du bureau en présentant
à l'utilisateur un bureau virtuel sur lequel il est possible de placer des
icônes de toutes sortes (représentant des lanceurs d'applications, des dossiers
ou des fichiers), complété d'un tableau de bord très personnalisable permettant
de lancer des programmes ou d'afficher des notifications.

À partir de la version 3.0, GNOME adopte un nouveau paradigme pour l'interface
utilisateur, orchestré par GNOME Shell.

La métaphore du bureau, jugée non optimale, est abandonnée.

La nouvelle interface met l'accent sur la possibilité de basculer facilement
d'une tâche à l'autre et l'utilisation de multiples espaces de travail pour
gérer les tâches.

Name
====

Initially “GNOME” was an acronym of GNU Network Object Model Environment,
referring to the original intention of creating a distributed object framework
similar to Microsoft’s OLE; but it was dropped[8] because this no longer reflects
the core vision of the GNOME project.


Look and feel
==============


Up until the release of GNOME 3.x, GNOME was designed around the traditional
computing desktop metaphor.
Users can change the appearance of their desktop through the use of themes, which
usually consist of an icon set, a window manager border and GTK+ theme engine
and parameters. The current default theme is Adwaita.
The Human Interface Guidelines helps developers to produce applications that
look and behave similarly to each other, which provides a cohesive GNOME experience.

GNOME has evolved from a traditional desktop metaphor to a user interface where
switching between different tasks and virtual workspaces takes place in a new
area called the overview.

The redesigned GNOME experience features several main changes: released as the
new interface for Gnome, GNOME Shell replaces the original GNOME Panel; Mutter
replaces Metacity as the default window manager; the minimize and maximize
buttons are no longer placed on the titlebar by default.

Many of the default GNOME applications have also gone through redesigns to
provide a more consistent and unified user experience.

In the default configuration of GNOME, the desktop has a top panel holding
(from left to right) an activities button, clock, system status area and user
menu. Clicking on the activities button or moving one's mouse to the top-left
hot corner, brings one to the overview.

The system status area holds various system indicators, such as those for
volume, Bluetooth, network, battery, and accessibility.

The user menu holds a chat availability indicator, shortcuts to system settings,
as well as session actions such as logging out, switching users, locking the
screen, or suspending the computer.

The overview (accessed by clicking on the activities button in the top panel,
or touching the top-left hot corner) shows the window picker,the workspace
changer on the right, the dash on the left, a windows button, an applications
button, and a search bar.
While in the overview, users can click on the windows and application buttons
just under the top panel to switch between the window picker and the application
picker. The window picker provides a way to switch to other open windows; a
convenient way to close multiple windows easily; and gives users a quick
overview of current activities. The application provides an easy way to launch
applications. The dash houses shortcuts to favorite applications and open windows.

Also in the default interface are a new system for notifications.

In GNOME 3, notifications popup from the bottom of the screen, as opposed to
showing in the top-right of the screen as in GNOME 2.x
