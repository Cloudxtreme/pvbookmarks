In graphical computing, a desktop environment (DE) commonly refers to a particular
implementation of graphical user interface (GUI) derived from the desktop
metaphor that is seen on most modern personal computers.

These GUIs help the user in easily accessing, configuring, and modifying many
important and frequently accessed specific operating system (OS) features.

The GUI usually does not afford access to all the many features found in an OS.
Instead, the traditional command-line interface (CLI) is still used when full
control over the OS is required in such cases.


A desktop environment typically consists of icons, windows, toolbars, folders,
wallpapers and desktop widgets (see Elements of graphical user interfaces and WIMP).

A GUI might also provide drag and drop functionality and other features that
make the desktop metaphor more complete.

A desktop environment aims to be an intuitive way for the user to interact with
the computer using concepts which are similar to those used when interacting
with the physical world, such as buttons and windows.

While the term desktop environment originally described a style of user
interfaces following the desktop metaphor, it has also come to describe the
programs that realize the metaphor itself.

This usage has been popularized by the Common Desktop Environment and the K
Desktop Environment.
