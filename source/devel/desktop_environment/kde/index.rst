KDE (play /ˌkeɪdiːˈiː/) is an international free software community producing an
integrated set of cross-platform applications designed to run on Linux, FreeBSD,
Microsoft Windows, Solaris and Mac OS X systems.

It is best known for its Plasma Desktop, a desktop environment provided as the
default working environment on many Linux distributions, such as Kubuntu, Pardus
and openSUSE.

The goal of the community is to provide basic desktop functions and applications
for daily needs as well as tools and documentation for developers to write
stand-alone applications for the system. In this regard, the KDE project serves
as an umbrella project for many standalone applications and smaller projects
that are based on KDE technology. These include Calligra Suite, digiKam, Rekonq,
K3b and many others.

KDE software is based on the Qt framework. The original GPL version of this
toolkit only existed for the X11 platform, but with the release of Qt 4,
LGPL versions are available for all platforms.

This allows KDE software based on Qt 4 to also be distributed to Microsoft Windows
and Mac OS X.
