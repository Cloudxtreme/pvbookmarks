The KDE Development Platform 4.7.0 A wide range of KDE and third party software

to the semantic desktop components, with enriched APIs and improved stability.

into workspaces and applications.

smoother user experience and a reduced footprint of applications using the

New Instant Messaging integrated directly into desktop
======================================================

The KDE-Telepathy team is proud to announce the technical preview and historic
first release of the new IM solution for KDE. Even though it's still in its
early stages, you can already set up all sorts of accounts, including GTalk
and Facebook Chat and use them in your everyday life.

The chat interface lets you choose among many appearances with its support of
Adium themes. You can also put the Presence Plasma widget right into your
panel to manage your online status. As this project is not yet mature enough
to be part of the big KDE family, it is packaged and released separately,
alongside the other major parts of KDE.

The source code for KDE-Telepathy 0.1.0  is available on http://download.kde.org.

Installation instructions are available on http://community.kde.org.


Stability As Well As Features
=============================

In addition to the many new features described in the release announcements,
KDE contributors have closed over 12,000 bug reports (including over 2,000
unique bugs in the software released today) since the last major releases of
KDE software. As a result, our software is more stable than ever before.
