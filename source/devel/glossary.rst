    USB
        USB (Universal Serial Bus) is a specification to establish communication
        between devices and a host controller (usually personal computers).
        USB is intended to replace many varieties of serial  and parallel ports.
        USB can connect computer peripherals such as mice, keyboards, digital
        cameras, printers, personal media players, flash drives, and external
        hard drives.
