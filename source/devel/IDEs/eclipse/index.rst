Introduction
============

Eclipse is a multi-language software development environment comprising an
integrated development environment (IDE) and an extensible plug-in system.

It is written mostly in Java and can be used to develop applications in Java
and, by means of various plug-ins, other programming languages including Ada,
C, C++, COBOL, Perl, PHP, Python, Ruby (including Ruby on Rails framework),
Scala, Clojure, and Scheme.

The IDE is often called:

- Eclipse ADT for Ada or :ref:`Android <android_eclipse_plugin>`
- Eclipse CDT for C/C++,
- Eclipse JDT for Java,
- and Eclipse PDT for PHP.
