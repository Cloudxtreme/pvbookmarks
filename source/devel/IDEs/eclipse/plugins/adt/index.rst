Introduction
============


``Android Development Tools`` (**ADT**) is a plugin for the Eclipse IDE that is designed
to give you a powerful, integrated environment in which to build Android applications.

``ADT`` extends the capabilities of Eclipse to let you quickly set up new Android
projects, create an application UI, add packages based on the Android Framework API,
debug your applications using the Android SDK tools, and even export signed
(or unsigned) .apk files in order to distribute your application.

Developing in Eclipse with ADT is **highly recommended** and is the fastest way to
get started. With the guided project setup it provides, as well as tools integration,
custom XML editors, and debug output pane, ``ADT`` gives you an incredible boost
in developing Android applications.

This document provides step-by-step instructions on how to download the ADT plugin
and install it into your Eclipse development environment.

Note that before you can install or use ADT, you must have compatible versions
of both the Eclipse IDE and the Android SDK installed.

For details, make sure to read `Installing the Eclipse Plugin`_.

If you are already using ``ADT``, this document also provides instructions on how
to update ADT to the latest version or how to uninstall it, if necessary.

For information about the features provided by the ADT plugin, such as code editor
features, SDK tool integration, and the graphical layout editor (for drag-and-drop
layout editing), see the `Android Developer Tools document`_.
