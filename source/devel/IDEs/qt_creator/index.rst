You can develop great Qt code using nothing more than Qt Creator and the final
release of SDKs. Polished. Stable. Commercial grade.

On the other hand, if you want to be among the first developers to work with the
latest Qt features, you can work with Qt’s source code.

Features don’t get much fresher than that.

If you’re ready to drink from the source, this article describes how to set up
your local development environment, how to use Git to get Qt’s source code, and
how to build the libraries on your machine.
