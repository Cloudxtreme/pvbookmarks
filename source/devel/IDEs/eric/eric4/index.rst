Getting the eric4 code
=======================

Eric4 uses Subversion (svn) for managing its code.


Assuming you have Subversion installed, the following command in a terminal
will fetch the most recent code for you::

    svn co http://die-offenbachs.homelinux.org/svn/eric4repository/eric4/trunk/

After you got the eric4 code you have to run the 'compileUiFiles.py' script in
order to convert the forms files (.ui) to valid Python code.

Stable and snapshot releases of eric4 are available at the eric download page
