Getting the Eric5 code
=======================

Eric5 uses Mercurial (hg) for managing its code.

Assuming you have Mercurial installed, the following command in a terminal
will fetch the most recent code for you::

    hg clone http://die-offenbachs.homelinux.org/hg/eric5

After you got the eric5 code you have to run the 'compileUiFiles.py' script
in order to convert the forms files (.ui) to valid Python code.
