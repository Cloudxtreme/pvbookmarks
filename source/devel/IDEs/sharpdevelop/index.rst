SharpDevelop is a free and open source IDE for the programming languages C#,
Visual Basic .NET (VB.NET), Boo, F# (starting at version 3.0), IronPython, and
Clarion.

It is typically used as an **alternative to Microsoft's Visual Studio .NET**

Early in its development there was a fork to Mono/Gtk# called MonoDevelop which
includes cross-platform support.
