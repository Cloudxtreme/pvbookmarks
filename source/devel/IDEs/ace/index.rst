Introduction
============   

Ace is a standalone code editor written in JavaScript. Our goal is to create a 
browser based editor that matches and extends the features, usability and 
performance of existing native editors such as TextMate, Vim or Eclipse. 

It can be easily embedded in any web page or JavaScript application. 

Ace is developed as the primary editor for Cloud9 IDE and the successor of the 
Mozilla Skywriter (Bespin) Project.

Plone editor

PloneIDE is an IDE intended to make Plone development faster and easier. 
It runs on top of Plone as a third party product, so it runs inside the browser. 
For this, it uses Ace, the editor used in the Ajax.org's Cloud9 IDE.

I bet i lost some of you when i mentioned the fact that you will be coding 
inside the browser, but give it a try. It's amazingly fast, so you'll forget 
you're inside a browser.
