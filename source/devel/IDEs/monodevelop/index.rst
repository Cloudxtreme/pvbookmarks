Introduction
=============

MonoDevelop is an open-source integrated development environment for the Linux
platform, Mac OS X, and Microsoft Windows, primarily targeted for the
development of software that uses both the Mono and Microsoft .NET frameworks.

MonoDevelop integrates features similar to those of NetBeans and Microsoft
Visual Studio, such as automatic code completion, source control, a graphical
user interface (GUI) and Web designer.

MonoDevelop integrates a Gtk# GUI designer called Stetic.

It currently has language support for C#, Java, Boo, Visual Basic.NET, Oxygene,
CIL, Python, Vala, C and C++.
