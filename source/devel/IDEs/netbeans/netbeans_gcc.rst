NetBeans IDE Bundle for C
=========================

The NetBeans IDE Bundle for C adds support for C developers since
NetBeans IDE 5.5.

This pack lets C developers use their specified set of compilers and
tools in conjunction with NetBeans IDE to build native applications
for Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, and Solaris.

The NetBeans C bundle **does not include a C compiler**.
