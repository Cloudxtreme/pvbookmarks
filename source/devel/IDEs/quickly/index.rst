Introduction
=============

To make Ubuntu development as sleek, simple, and powerful as possible, we have
created a tool called Quickly that gets you up and running right away.

Quickly integrates project creation, code editing, GUI editing, running and
debugging, as well as packaging and sharing via Launchpad.net, all in one easy
to use command line interface.

Quickly generates your project ready to run with everything you need for a
complete Ubuntu Application.

Quickly also comes with great tutorials and a great community of developers to
help you create whatever applications you can imagine.

Quickly is not an IDE.

Rather, Quickly works by first choosing the right technologies for creating the
kind of project you want to create for Ubuntu. And then it integrates those
choices into the desktop and into Launchpad.net for you, all controlled with a
few easy commands.

Quickly has templates to help you create a Ubuntu application, a command line
application, and a game, with more templates being created all the time.

Quickly provides:

- An Easy Choice – When you start an application with Quickly, all the hard
  decisions have been made.
- Easy and Fun Application Generation – When you write an application with
  Quickly, all the boiler plate has been written for you.
- Packaging and Sharing – Quickly applications are super easy to package and
  distribute.
- Help – Quickly comes with tutorials and detailed help, and there is even a
  #quickly irc channel.

===============================

Given the richness and variety of the Linux platform, programming on Linux should
be easy and fun. However, it's not easy and fun because it is too hard to learn.
It is too hard to learn because there are too many choices, and too much
information to wade through. Quickly strives to make programming easy and fun
by bringing opinionated choices about how to write different kinds of programs
to developers. Included is a Ubuntu application template for making applications
that integrate smoothly into the Ubuntu software infrastructure.
