Python Tools for Visual Studio is a free & open source plug-in for Visual
Studio 2010 from Microsoft's Technical Computing Group.

PTVS enables developers to use all the major productivity features of Visual
Studio to build Python code using either CPython or IronPython and adds new
features such as using High Performance Computing clusters to scale your code.

Together with one of the standard distros, you can turn Visual Studio into a
powerful Technical Computing IDE...

Note: PTVS is not a Python distribution; it works with your existing
Python/IronPython installation to provide you an integrated editing and
debugging experience.
