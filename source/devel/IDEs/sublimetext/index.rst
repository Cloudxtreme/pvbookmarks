Sublime Text 2 is a very powerful text editor which has gained popularity
recently – for good reasons. It is commercial (59 USD).

Plenty of power comes from the fact that Sublime has a plug-in framework built
in Python. Even though the core app remains closed there exist a vibrant plug-
in ecosystem around the editor.

Note: You can try Sublime for free. It simply gives nagging dialog “Please buy”
now and then.

Here is my collection of tips how I squeezed more power out of the editor.
The tips are written from OSX perspective, but should work fine on Linux and Windows too.
