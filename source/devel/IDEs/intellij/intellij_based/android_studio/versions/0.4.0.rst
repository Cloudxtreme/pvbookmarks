What's new
===========

Support for the new Android Gradle plugin, 0.7.0, which has improvements for 
render script, lint, BuildConfig, ProGuard, and additional features around 
source folders and flavors, along with many bug fixes. 

For more information, see the Build System documentation.

Initial Eclipse (ADT) project import 
-------------------------------------

You can now directly import Eclipse projects (rather than having to export 
them to :ref:`Gradle` from Eclipse as in the past). 

This importer also makes structural changes to the import:

It migrates the project structure from the old ADT directory structure to the 
new Gradle-build system one

It removes inlined library projects that it recognizes (ActionBarSherlock, v7 GridLayout) 
and replaces the source code with a simple Gradle dependency to the corresponding library

Similarly it removes .jar files that it recognizes and replaces them with 
Gradle dependencies

It generates an import summary where it lists potential import issues 
(for example, if you were using library projects without manifest merging, 
there is potential manifest registration duplication now)

(The import does not yet fully support path variables and linked resources; 
this will be fixed in 0.4.1)
