Mozilla applications store a user's personal information in a unique profile.

The first time you start any Mozilla application, it will automatically create
a default profile; additional profiles can be created using the Profile Manager.

The settings which form a profile are stored in files within a special folder
on your computer — this is the profile folder.

The installation directory also includes a "profile" folder but this folder
contains program defaults, not your user profile data
