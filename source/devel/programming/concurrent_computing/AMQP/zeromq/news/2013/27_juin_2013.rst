Hi all,

For interest, last week I spoke to a large group of developers at
CERN, in Geneva. CERN is using ZeroMQ (in C++ and Java) to build their
next generation control system for the LHC, the largest and most
powerful particle accelerator in the world.

Here's the video of my presentation: https://vimeo.com/69666055

it's long (75 minutes) but may be useful to those wondering what the
vision behind ZeroMQ is/was.
