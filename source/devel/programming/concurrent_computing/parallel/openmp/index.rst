Introduction
============

OpenMP (Open Multiprocessing) is an API that supports multi-platform shared memory
multiprocessing programming in C, C++, and Fortran, on most processor architectures
and operating systems, including Solaris, AIX, HP-UX, GNU/Linux, Mac OS X, and
Windows platforms.

It consists of a set of compiler directives, library routines, and environment
variables that influence run-time behavior.
