This week, as I was preparing my `presentation on C#`_  on iOS and Android, 
I came to the realization that callback-based programming has somehow become 
an acceptable programming model.

It has become an acceptable programming model, in the same way that using 
IF/GOTO to write programs was an acceptable model back in the 60's. 

They are acceptable because we did not have anything better to replace them.

Today, both C# and F# support a programming model that will do to our 
generation what structured programming, high-level languages and control 
flow primitives did to the developers in the 60'
