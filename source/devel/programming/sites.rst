Rosetta Code is a programming _chrestomathie_ site.

The idea is to present solutions to the same task in as many different languages
as possible, to demonstrate how languages are similar and different, and to aid
a person with a grounding in one approach to a problem in learning another.

Rosetta Code currently has 610 tasks, 107 draft tasks, and is aware of 483
languages, though we do not (and cannot) have solutions to every task in every
language.
