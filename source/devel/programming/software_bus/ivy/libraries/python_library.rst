Introduction
============

Ivy is a lightweight software bus for quick-prototyping protocols. It allows 
applications to broadcast information through text messages, with a 
subscription mechanism based on regular expressions.

If you're used to the standard Ivy API, you probably want to look at the 
std_api module.

The Ivy software bus was designed at the French Centre d'Etudes de la 
Navigation Aerienne (CENA). The original work: sofware, documentation, 
papers, credits can be found on the Ivy Home Page; it contains all the 
necessary materials needed to understand Ivy.

This package is the Python library; Ivy librairies are also available for 
numerous languages, among wich: C, C#, C++, Java, Perl --see the Ivy Download 
Page for details.

This python library is a full rewrite of the original software, and it is 
written in **pure python**. 
Note that another python implementation is available at the Ivy downloads page, 
which is built by SWIG on top of the Ivy C library.
