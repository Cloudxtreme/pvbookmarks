This table shows which version of the Timezone data is included in the 
different releases of the Java Development Kit (JDK) software and the 
TZUpdater tool. 

Further information about the contents of the timezone data releases is 
contained in the related request for enhancement (RFE) for that release. 

Where a major timezone change has been included in a timezone data release, 
this is described in the last column.
