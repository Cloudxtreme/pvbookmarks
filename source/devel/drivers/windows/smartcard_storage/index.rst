Smart card vendors can write card minidrivers to present a consistent interface 
to their smart card type to the Microsoft Smart Card Base Cryptographic Service 
Provider (CSP) or Crypto Next Generation (CNG) Key Storage Provider (KSP) and 
to the Smart Card Management Interface. These card minidrivers plug in to Windows 
operating system code. The functionality in a card minidriver is narrowly scoped 
and carefully defined so that the card-dependent code is simple to implement 
and easy to verify functionally.
