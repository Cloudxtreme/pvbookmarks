> Hi,

Hello,

That is a good idea to use the pcsc_spy log. You are the first one to do that.

> As you can see, the sending of SCardConnect is interrupted and nothing else happens!

I do not see any interruption.  SCardConnec() do not return but is not
interrupted.

> Any idea?

What is the pcscd log?
