    objet   [Libusb-devel] Another HID library



Right now Linux is not supported, Windows and Mac OS X are supported.

According to the author, Linux support is on his todo list. Perl/Ruby/Python
bindings are also on the list after the Linux support.

Also according to the author, the license is 2-clause BSD even though
he does not really care what people do with it so long as he does
not get sued.

The library looks quite interesting and seems hotplug is supported
as well. It is unfortunately named the same as the existing libhid.
