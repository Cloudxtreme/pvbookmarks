Introduction
============

This is a library for accessing USB Human Interface Devices (HIDs) on Mac OS X,
from within C++ or Python.

Its philosophy is somewhat inspired by the SWT widget libraries for Java, in
that it provides only very simple, low-level native APIs in C, getting as quickly
as possible into a high-level language to provide clean, friendly APIs there.
