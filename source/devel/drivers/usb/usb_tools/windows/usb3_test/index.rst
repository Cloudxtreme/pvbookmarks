In order to use USB30CV, User Account Control (UAC) must be turned off. After
turning off UAC, the system must be rebooted.

If you are running on 64-bit Windows, you must install the 64-bit CV.

If you have any questions, please contact ssusbcompliance@usb.org. If you have
installed a previous version of the USB 3.0 Command Verifier, you must uninstall
it before installing the new version.

USB 3.0 Command Verifier (USB30CV) is the official tool for USB 3.0 (SuperSpeed USB)
Hub and Device Framework testing.

All USB 3.0 peripherals are required to pass the Device Framework tests in order
to gain certification.

The USB30CV tool includes the xHCI Compliance Drivers for use with the USB30CV.

The tool also includes an xHCI Prototype Driver for host interoperability support.
