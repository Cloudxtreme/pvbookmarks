HAL

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HAL_%28software%29


HAL is a software project providing a hardware abstraction layer for Unix-like  
computer systems. It aims to allow desktop applications to discover and use 
the hardware of the host system through a simple, portable and abstract API, 
regardless of the type of the underlying hardware.

HAL was originally envisioned by Havoc Pennington and is now a freedesktop.org 
project, being a key part of the software stack of the GNOME and KDE desktop 
environments. It is free software, dual-licensed under both the GNU General 
Public License and the Academic Free License.

.. warning:: 
   HAL is now deprecated, with functionality being merged into udev as of 2008â€“2010; 


HAL is deprecated
=================

As of 2009, distributions such as Ubuntu,  Debian, and Fedora,and projects  
such as GNOME and X.org are in the process of deprecating HAL as it has 
"become a large monolithic unmaintainable mess". 

It is in the process of being merged into udev (main udev, libudev, and 
udev-extras) and existing udev and kernel functionality. 

Ubuntu version 10.04 removes HAL from the boot process.

Initially a new daemon DeviceKit was planned to replace certain aspects 
of HAL, but in March 2009, DeviceKit was deprecated in favor of adding 
the same code to udev as a package: udev-extras, and some functions 
have now moved to udev proper.
