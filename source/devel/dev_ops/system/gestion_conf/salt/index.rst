Description
===========

``Salt`` is an open source configuration management and remote execution application. 

Salt is written with the intent of making central system management and 
configuration as simple, yet as flexible as possible


History
========

Salt originated from the need for high speed data collection and execution in 
system administration environments. 
The author of Salt, Thomas S Hatch, had previously created a number of in-house 
solutions for companies to solve the problem but found his and other open source 
solutions to be lacking.

Hatch decided to use the ZeroMQ messaging library to facilitate the high-speed 
requirements and built Salt using ZeroMQ for all networking layers.
