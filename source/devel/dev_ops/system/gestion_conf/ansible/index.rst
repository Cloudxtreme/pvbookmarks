Description
===========

Ansible is an open-source software platform for configuring and managing computers. 

It combines multi-node software deployment, ad hoc task execution, and 
configuration management. 

Additionally, Ansible prefers to be categorized as an orchestration engine.

It manages nodes over SSH and does not require any additional remote software 
(except Python 2.4 or later) to be installed on them. 

Modules work over JSON and standard output and can be written in any programming 
language. 

The system uses YAML to express reusable descriptions of systems.
