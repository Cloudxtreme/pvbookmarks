Maestro provides the ability to easily launch, orchestrate and manage mulitple 
Docker containers as single unit. 

Container sets are defined in a simple YAML format that allows you to define 
how the containers should be created and to specify relationships between 
containers. 

The intention is to make easy to create and use complex multi-node container 
environments for testing and development.
