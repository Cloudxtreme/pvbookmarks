Announce
=========

   
On March 20, 2013, we released the first version of Docker.  

After 15 months, 8,741 commits from more than 460 contributors, 2.75 million 
downloads, over 14,000 “Dockerized” apps, and feedback from 10s of 1000s of 
users about their experience with Docker, from a single container on a laptop 
to 1000s in production in the cloud … we’re excited to announce that it’s here: Docker 1.0.


What’s In A Number ?
=====================

We think this milestone means several things:

First, while many organizations have cheerfully ignored our “Do not run in production!” 
warnings, others have been waiting for a level of product maturity before deploying 
production workloads.  

This release’s “1.0” label signifies a level of quality, feature completeness, 
backward compatibility and API stability to meet enterprise IT standards.  

In addition, to provide a full solution for using Docker in production we’re 
also delivering complete documentation, training programs, professional services, 
and enterprise support.

Second, this milestone signifies Docker’s coming into its own as an open platform 
for distribution apps.  
In particular, the community’s use of Docker in such a wide variety of use-cases 
and apps in every phase of the application lifecycle confirms this.  

So from today you’ll hear us talk about Docker as a **platform**, its components 
being **Docker Engine**, the container runtime and packaging tool, and Docker Hub, 
a cloud-based service for collaboration, content, and workflow automation.

Third, the “1.0” designation and platform recognition opens the door for 
continued innovation on many fronts.  We don’t want to steal his thunder, so be 
sure to tune-in to Solomon’s keynote tomorrow morning to get a first look at 
early versions of these new platform services and capabilities
