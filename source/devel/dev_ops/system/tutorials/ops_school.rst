To have a complete syllabus for training smart persons with high potential who
already have a basic understanding of Linux or other UNIX variant, to become
strong junior systems administrators.

This course will focus on the Linux platform as a basis for competency in any
UNIX ecosystem. Usenix defines this role as::

    Familiarity with an operating system and its commands/utilities at a user
    level; ability to edit files, use basic utilities and commands, find users’
    home directories, navigate through the file system, install software on
    workstations, and use I/O redirection; some understanding of how user
    authentication happens in a directory service context.
    Ability to identify/locate shared resources and perform simple tasks
    (e.g., manipulate jobs in a print queue, figure out why a network file
    system isn’t available).

Our goal is to teach these topics, but also to provide a good understanding of
how the components work, which enables them to continue to grow their skills
and contributions.

Our focus is any person who has an interest in operations. There are often
personality traits which allow people to understand the role of a systems
administrator more easily, but the material should be easily accessible to
anybody who wishes to learn about it.

The required minimum skill level before participating will be as follows:

- Has installed Linux or other UNIX variant
- Is comfortable with, or even prefers, working on the command line
- Has a basic understanding on navigating the filesystem, and the most basic
  tools (ps, ls, top, etc).
