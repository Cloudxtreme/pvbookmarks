Description
============

Vagrant 1.7 comes with a new command: vagrant push. 

Just as "vagrant up" is a single command to create a development environment 
for any application, vagrant push is a single command to deploy any application.

The goal of Vagrant is to give developers a single workflow to develop 
applications effectively. 

"vagrant up" creates a development environment for any application and 
"vagrant share" enables collaboration for any application. 
Deploying was the next logical step for Vagrant, now possible with "vagrant push".

Like every other component of Vagrant, push can be configured using multiple 
strategies. "vagrant push" can deploy via FTP, Heroku, Atlas, or by executing 
any local script. 

Other strategies can be added via plugins and more will be added to core as 
time goes on.
