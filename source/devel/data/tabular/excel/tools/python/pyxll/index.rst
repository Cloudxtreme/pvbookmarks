Introduction
=============

For organizations who want to provide Python-based algorithms and analyses to 
end-users in Excel, PyXLL makes Python a performant, flexible back-end for 
Excel worksheets. 

PyXLL streamlines deployment from R&D to end users to greatly reduce time-to-value 
for new strategies and algorithms. 

Teams in investment banks, hedge funds and engineering organizations worldwide 
are using PyXLL to bring the full power of the Python ecosystem to their Excel 
end-users.


- Increase productivity by using a modern dynamic language ``Python``.
- Reduce risk by storing code in version control instead of embedded in Excel.
- Deploy code updates more easily to Excel users with centralized code.
- Reduce coding iteration cycles by removing the compile-and-restart step 
  usually associated with C++ add-ins.
- Improve productivity and performance using the full Python ecosystem: 
  Numpy, Pandas, SciPy and the full SciPy stack.
