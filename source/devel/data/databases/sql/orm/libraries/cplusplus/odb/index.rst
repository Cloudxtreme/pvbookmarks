Introduction
============


ODB is an open-source, cross-platform, and cross-database
object-relational mapping (ORM) system for C++. It allows
you to persist C++ objects to a relational database
without having to deal with tables, columns, or SQL and without
manually writing any mapping code. The following example shows
an ordinary C++ class on the left and its persistent version
on the right.



Free and Open Source Licenses
=============================

ODB is available with full source code and can be
used with open source databases (SQLite, PostgreSQL,
MySQL, etc.) as well as free editions of commercial databases
(Oracle Express, SQL Server Express, etc.) under the terms of
the GNU General Public License
(GPL) version 2.

ODB can also be used free of charge non-commercially or for
evaluation with non-free editions of commercial databases (Oracle,
SQL Server, etc) under the terms of the
ODB Non-Commercial Use and Evaluation
License (NCUEL).

By linking with the ODB runtime libraries (directly or indirectly,
statically or dynamically, at compile time or runtime), your
application is subject to the terms of the GPL and/or NCUEL
which both require that you release the source code
of your application if and when you distribute it. Distributing
an application includes giving it to customers, contractors,
parent companies, subsidiaries, or any legal entity other than
your own. On the other hand, if you only use your application
within your organization, such as running it on your company's
servers, then you do not need to make your source code public.
