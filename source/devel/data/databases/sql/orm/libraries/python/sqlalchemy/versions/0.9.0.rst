Sqlalchemy 0.9.0 
====================================================


Targeting Python 2.6 and Up Now, Python 3 without 2to3

The first achievement of the 0.9 release is to remove the dependency on the 
2to3 tool for Python 3 compatibility. 

To make this more straightforward, the lowest Python release targeted now 
is 2.6, which features a wide degree of cross-compatibility with Python 3. 

All SQLAlchemy modules and unit tests are now interpreted equally well with any 
Python interpreter from 2.6 forward, including the 3.1 and 3.2 interpreters.

At the moment, the C extensions are still not fully ported to Python 3.
