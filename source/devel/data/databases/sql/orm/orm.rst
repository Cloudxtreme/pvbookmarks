Introduction
============

Object-relational mapping (ORM, O/RM, and O/R mapping) in computer software is a
programming technique for converting data between incompatible type systems in
object-oriented programming languages.

This creates, in effect, a "virtual object database" that can be used from within
the programming language.

There are both free and commercial packages available that perform object-relational
mapping, although some programmers opt to create their own ORM tools.
