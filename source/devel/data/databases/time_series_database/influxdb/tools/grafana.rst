Overview
=========

``Grafana`` is a frontend for Graphite and InfluxDB with powerfull visualization 
features for time series data. 

You will need either a Graphite or InfluxDB server for Grafana to be of any use.

It is very easy to install and configure Grafana as it is a client side 
application that runs in your browser. 

Besides Graphite or InfluxDB, it only has one optional external dependency and 
that is Elasticsearch. 

Elasticsearch is used to store, load and search for dashboards. 

But you can use Grafana without it.
