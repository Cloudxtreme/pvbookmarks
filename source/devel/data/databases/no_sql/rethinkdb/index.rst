Introduction
=============

RethinkDB is built to store JSON documents, and scale to multiple machines with 
very little effort. 

It has a pleasant query language that supports really useful queries like table 
joins and group by, and is easy to setup and learn. 


Easy administration
--------------------

- Friendly web and command-line administration tools.
- Takes care of machine failures and network interrupts.
- Multi-datacenter replication and failover.
