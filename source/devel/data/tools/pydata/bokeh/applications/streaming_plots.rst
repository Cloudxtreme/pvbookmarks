Introduction
=============

Bokeh is quickly proving to be the easiest plotting toolkit for web-enabled 
graphs. 

Continuum recently released version 0.2 , with 0.3 coming shortly. 

One of the distinguishing features of Bokeh compared to other web-based plotting 
toolkits is that streaming, as a feature, is not an afterthought. 

Animated as well as streaming realtime plots on the web should be nearly as 
easy as static plots, and with Bokeh, **it really is that easy**. 

Itâ€™s good to remind yourself that Bokeh is built with Python as a 
first-class citizen, in other words, all of the plotting commands are in 
Python and NOT Javascript. 

Bokeh is open-source and our documentation has loads of beautiful interactive 
plots.
