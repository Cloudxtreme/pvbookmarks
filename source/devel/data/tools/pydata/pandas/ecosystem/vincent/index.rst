Concept
========

The data capabilities of Python. The visualization capabilities of JavaScript.

Vincent takes Python data structures and translates them into Vega_ 
visualization grammar. 

It allows for quick iteration of visualization designs via getters and setters 
on grammar elements, and outputs the final visualization to JSON.

Perhaps most importantly, Vincent groks Pandas DataFrames and Series in an 
intuitive way.
