Plotly is like graphing crack. 

It standardizes the graphing interface across scientific computing languages 
(Python, R, MATLAB, ect) while giving rich interactivity and web shareability 
that has not been possible before with matplotlib, ggplot, MATLAB, ect. 

On the Plotly website, you can style your graphs with a GUI, so you don't have 
to spend hours writing code that simply changes the legend opacity.

Plotly does this all while backing up your graphs on the cloud, so that years 
later, you can find data that may have otherwise been on a harddrive in a landfill. 

If you make your data public, other people can also find your graphs and data. 

The best practice that we have today for saving and sharing research data is to 
entomb it as a thesis in the engineering library basement. All that is changing.

Like d3.js? Like interactive, NYT graphics? So do we. 

Now, with the Plotly APIs, you can make them yourself without being an expert 
web programmer. If you are an expert web programmer, now you have scientific 
languages and tools like R, Python, Pandas, and MATLAB instead of javascript 
to wrangle your data and create beautiful data vis. 

Science meets the world-wide-web. Engineering meets design. Let's do this.

I'm going to show you this brave new world below, starting with bubble charts. 

Bubble charts are sweet because they take advantage of the innate interactivity 
of Plotly graphs. When you hover on a bubble chart point, you want to see what 
its size represents, you want to zoom-in to points that are clustered, and you 
want to pan around once you're zoomed-in. 

You become a Bubble Chart Explorer. Plotly lets you do all this, all while 
upping the game for scientific, publication-quality graphics.
