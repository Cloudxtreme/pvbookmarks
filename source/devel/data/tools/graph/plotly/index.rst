Import and wrangle
===================

Any data format works â€” Excel spreadsheets, CSV, TSV, Matlab data files, 
MS Access, or text. 

If your format doesn't work, get in touch! You can always reach Plotly on 
twitter or feedback [at] plot [dot] ly.

Bring data in from anywhere: upload from your computer, copy-paste, drag and 
drop a file, or import from Google Drive and Dropbox.

Clean it up fast. Find and replace, convert date-time formats, interpolate, 
and more.



Analyze, or simulate
=====================

Do the math! Apply any custom function to your data.

Derivatives, integrals, fits, and more.

Stats galore. Inferential or descriptive basic statistics, chi-squared test, 
T-test, and ANOVA.

Writing a simulation? Code up a python script or use the built-in python 
sandbox (you can even import any python package, like numpy, scipy, or pandas).



Graph it
=========

Scatter, line, bar, area, error bar, heatmap, box, histogram... making graphs 
is a snap.

Interactive plots let you zoom, pan, hover for data values, and more.

Export to PNG, SVG, PDF, or EPS.

We've got beautiful defaults. No need to stress about colors if that's not your 
thing.

But don't worry, you've got total control. Every parameter of a graph's 
appearance can be adjusted.


Share and collaborate
======================

Share and edit your data, graphs and scripts privately with your coworkers, or 
show the world.

Discuss your projects with your team, and get feedback from your teacher or boss.

Stay up-to-date with unobtrusive notifications.
Version control has your back when things go wrong.

The Plotly community is growing! Profiles and search are coming soon.


Flexibility, built in
======================

Creature of habit when it comes to code? No problem. You can make shareable, 
beautiful, interactive graphs in your browser from the comfort of your desktop 
with our APIs for Python, MATLAB, R, Julia, REST, Arduino, or Perl.

You can use the Arduino and REST APIs to stream data from hardware devices, too.

Secure and privacy-conscious. Built with secure websockets, https, and Amazon S3.

Need consistent graph styling? Save a plot theme and apply the look and feel 
you want, whenever.

Plotly is still evolving, so if your needs aren't met, drop us a line.
