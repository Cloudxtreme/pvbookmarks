The problem: Creative Commons licensed content is awesome, but attributing it
properly can be difficult and confusing.

The first rule for re-using openly licensed content is that you have to properly
attribute the creator. There are specific requirements for what needs to go into
that attribution, but those requirements can be confusing and hard to find.

The solution: A simple tool everyone can use to do the right thing with the
click of a button.

That’s why we’re building Open Attribute, a suite of tools that makes it
ridiculously simple for anyone to copy and paste the correct attribution
for any CC licensed work.
These tools will query the metadata around a CC-licensed object and produce
a properly formatted attribution that users can copy and paste wherever
they need to.

Open Attribute is a Mozilla Drumbeat project born at the
“Learning, Freedom and the Web” Festival in Barcelona.
A team of volunteers from all over the world has been collaborating to design,
build and now distribute Open Attribute.

Special Thanks to those who have worked so hard to make this a reality !
