PyGTK is a set of Python wrappers for the GTK+ graphical user interface library. 
PyGTK is free software and licensed under the LGPL. Other popular alternatives 
are PyQt and wxPython. Its original author is the prominent GNOME developer 
James Henstridge. Today there are six people in the core development team, 
with various other people who have submitted patches and bug reports. 
PyGTK has been selected as the environment of choice for applications running 
on the One Laptop Per Child systems. 
Developers and interested parties can usually be found on the IRC  
channel #pygtk on irc.gnome.org.

  a library of Python snippets and examples that demonstrate how to perform 
  specific tasks. Many of us learn by example, and having a library of examples 
  help us learn different modules faster and easier, helping us to write 
  awesome programs faster and easier.
