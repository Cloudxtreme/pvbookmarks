GTK+ (GIMP Toolkit) is a cross-platform widget toolkit for creating 
graphical user interfaces. It is one of the most popular toolkits for 
the X Window System, along with Qt.

GTK+ was initially created for the GNU Image Manipulation Program (GIMP)
, a raster graphics editor, in 1997 by Spencer Kimball and Peter Mattis, 
members of eXperimental Computing Facility (XCF) at University of 
California, Berkeley.

GTK+ is licensed under the LGPL free software license and is part of 
the GNU Project, which aims to create a whole free-software operating system.

History
=======

GTK+ was originally designed and used in the GNU Image Manipulation 
Program (GIMP) as a replacement of the Motif toolkit; at some point 
Peter Mattis became disenchanted with Motif and began to write his own 
GUI toolkit called the GIMP toolkit and had successfully replaced Motif 
by the 0.60 release of GIMP.[2] Finally GTK was re-written to be object 
oriented and was renamed GTK+. This was first used in the 0.99 release of GIMP.

GTK+ 2 has succeeded GTK+. Its new features include improved text 
rendering using Pango, a new theme engine, improved accessibility using 
the Accessibility Toolkit, complete transition to Unicode 
using UTF-8 strings, and a more flexible API. However, GTK+ 2 lacks 
compatibility with GTK+ 1, and programmers must port applications to it.
