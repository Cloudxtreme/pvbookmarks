In computing, Accessibility Toolkit (ATK) refers in particular to the 
GNOME ATK.

The GNOME ATK, a developer toolkit, allows programmers to use common 
GNOME accessibility features in their applications. This includes 
such features as high-contrast visual themes for the visually-impaired 
and keyboard behaviour modifiers (e.g. sticky keys) for those with 
diminished motor control.
