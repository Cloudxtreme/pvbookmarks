Introduction
============


Qt Quick, first introduced in Qt 4.7 and in Qt Creator 2.1, is a high-level UI 
technology that allows developers and UI designers to work together to create 
animated, touch-enabled UIs and lightweight applications. 

It includes:

- New Tools in the Qt Creator IDE: including a visual editor that allows UI 
  designers and developers to cooperate, working on the same code in an iterative 
  approach
- QML (Qt Meta-Object Language): an easy to use, declarative language
- QtDeclarative: a new module in the Qt library that enables a new declarative 
  programming approach

And while no C++ programming skills are needed to use Qt Quick, it is 100% based 
on Qt and can be extended from C++ (and other languages, thanks to the bindings), 
limited only by your creativity.
