WinMerge 3 will be modern compare/synchronization tool. It will be based on
Qt library and cross-platform. You can use the same tool in Windows and in Linux.

WinMerge will not be just WinMerge 2 with new GUI. There will be radical changes
in how WinMerge works and how it looks. Many features won't be available anymore
and new features will be added.
