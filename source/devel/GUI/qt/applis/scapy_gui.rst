If you want to use something ready as a starting point I suggest you
to look at my software which aims to be a backend independent packet
manipulator tool. Scapy is of course supported. You can download it
from: http://manipulator.umitproject.org

Actually if some student is interested to improve it UMIT is also
taking part to GSoC 2011 program.
