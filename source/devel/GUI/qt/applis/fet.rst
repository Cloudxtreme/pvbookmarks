FET is open source free software for automatically scheduling the timetable of
a school, high-school or university.

It uses a fast and efficient timetabling algorithm. It is licensed under GNU GPL.

Usually, FET is able to solve a complicated timetable in maximum 5-20 minutes.

For simpler timetables, it may take a shorter time, under 5 minutes
(in some cases, a matter of seconds).

For extremely difficult timetables, it may take a longer time, a matter of hours.
