When creating Windows Forms programs that accept input, you often need to ensure
that the input is of a specific format. For example, you need phone numbers to
have their area code and also the correct number of digits.

To solve this problem, you can use the MaskedTextBox control, as described in
this article.


Get started (MaskInputRejected)

To get started, please add a MaskedTextBox control to your Windows Forms program
by double-clicking on the icon in the toolbox.

Next, try changing the properties of the MaskedTextBox by right-clicking on it
and selecting properties.

**Importantly, change the Mask property**: you can find predefined masks for:

- integer numbers,
- phone numbers,
- dates in various formats,
- Social Security Numbers,
- time in various formats,
- and zip codes.
