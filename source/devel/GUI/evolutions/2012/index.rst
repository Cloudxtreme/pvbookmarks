Modern Cross Platform Development
=================================

Why isn't there a modern technology available for using the same codebase to
produce native apps on all of the currently popular platforms -

I'm talking iOS (iPhone/iPad/iPod Touch), Android, Windows, Mac and Linux?

That was my original question before I started looking, and since then I've
discovered there actually are plenty of new options out there for cross platform
development catering for all of the above platforms.

The main advantage of the browser app however, and its a massive one, is that its
everwhere and supported by every device, so if HTML5 takes off, then it could
become the defacto standard for developing apps of any kind, desktop or not.

As Jeff Atwood discusses in his seminal blog post `All Programming is Web Programming`_;
"the web is the most efficient, most pervasive, most immediate distribution
network for software ever created - its almost completely frictionless".

As Atwood mentions, more and more users gravitate towards preferring to run their
apps inside the browser, on smartphones and on tablets where things 'just work'
and there's generally nowhere near as much friction caused by the traditional
desktop software setup and update process.

A third option available now is the cross platform mobile development SDK as
detailed below (Mono, Appcelerator Titanium, Rhodes, PhoneGap, MoSync and Moai).

Smartphone and tablet based applications are taking off, and these SDKs allow
ou to write once and run on any of these new class of devices, as well as in
some cases also being able to run on the traditional desktop.

These would seem to offer some of the 'power' of the desktop in terms of native
code execution speed and access to hardware functionality, along with the
enourmous 'frictionless' benefit that you get when publishing to an app store,
where installing an app is literally a one click operation.
