About Fritzing
===============

Fritzing is an open-source initiative to support designers, artists, researchers
and hobbyists to work creatively with interactive electronics.

We are creating a software and website in the spirit of Processing_ and Arduino_,
developing a tool that allows users to document their prototypes, share them
with others, teach electronics in a classroom, and to create a pcb layout for
professional manufacturing.
