Introduction
============

ARM Holdings plc is a British multinational semiconductor and software 
design company with its head office in Cambridge, England. 

Its largest business is in processors, although it also designs software 
development tools under the RealView and Keil brands, systems and platforms, 
system-on-a-chip infrastructure and software. 

It is considered to be market dominant in the field of mobile phone 
chips based on the ARM architecture and is arguably the best-known of 
the 'Silicon Fen' companies.

The company was founded as Advanced RISC Machines, ARM, a joint venture 
between Acorn Computers, Apple Computer (now Apple Inc.) and VLSI Technology. 

The new company intended to further the development of the Acorn RISC 
Machine's RISC chip, which was originally used in the Acorn Archimedes 
and had been selected by Apple for their Newton project. 

The design was flexible and is now the processing core for many custom 
application-specific integrated circuits.

A characteristic feature of ARM processors is their low electric power 
consumption, which makes them particularly suitable for use in portable 
devices. 

In fact, almost all modern mobile phones and personal digital assistants 
contain ARM CPUs, making them the most widely used 32-bit microprocessor 
family in the world. 

Today ARMs account for over 75% of all 32-bit embedded CPUs.
