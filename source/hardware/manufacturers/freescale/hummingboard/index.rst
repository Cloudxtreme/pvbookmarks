Description
============

With the industry’s best Price Power Performance Ratio (P3R), the HummingBoard 
offers 1 GHz per core, has a proven SoC and wide scalability. 

Its compatibility with standard ARMv7 CPU power, HardFP and neon Linux packages 
means it has the widest support for standard ARM binary software packages without 
the need to recompile them, and the absence of any moving parts makes it long-lasting. 

Built to comply with both commercial and industrial standards of embedding, the 
HummingBoard is composed of only the highest quality components.
