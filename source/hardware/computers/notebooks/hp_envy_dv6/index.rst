Description
============

The Envy dv6-7202eg is currently the most expensive model (1,200 Euros/~$1571)
of a series of new 15.6-inch notebooks in our test parcours.

The laptop runs on a quad-core Intel Core i7-3630QM CPU with 16 GB of RAM.

Switchable graphics are included: either the Intel HD Graphics 4000 IGP 
or the Nvidia GeForce GT 630M GPU provides graphics output.

The storage device is a 1 TB hard disk and the icing on the cake is a 
Blu-ray burner.

Processor
=========

Hewlett Packard installs an Intel Core i7-3630QM in the Envy dv6. T

his is a quad-core CPU from the Intel Ivy Bridge generation.

The CPU operates at a clock speed of 2.4 GHz. Thanks to Turbo; the processor can
boost the speed of all four cores up to 3.2 GHz. A single-core can be boosted
to 3.4 GHz whereas two cores will reach 3.3 GHz.


System Performance
===================

The Envy dv6 is fast.

Windows 8 boots quickly and the results of the PC Mark 7 benchmark lie 
neck and neck with the Asus N56VZ-S4044V and the Lenovo IdeaPad Y580.

This is to be expected as all three models have similar processors and 
the same hard disk.


Graphics Card
==============

Two GPUs find a home in the Envy dv6: the Intel HD Graphics 4000 IGP and 
the Nvidia GeForce GT 630M GPU.

Depending on the task, the laptop picks the appropriate GPU; while running
demanding games, the Nvidia GPU kicks in, whereas the Intel IGP is used to
increase battery life.

In essence, both GPUs can be used for any task. Which GPU is used when, is
decided by the GPU profiles, or Nvidia Optimus. The profiles are delivered with
the Nvidia driver. They are regularly updated and can be configured to suit
the user's needs.

The Nvidia GeForce GT 630M GPU is a middle-class notebook graphics card which
supports DirectX 11. It works at 175 to 797.3 MHz and has 2 GB memory.

The Intel HD Graphics 4000 IGP is also DirectX 11-ready. It runs at 350 to 1,100 MHz.

The results of the 3DMark benchmark lie at the expected level. The HP Envy dv6
simply cannot keep up with the Asus N56VZ-S4044V (Intel Core i7-3610QM, Nvidia
GeForce GT 650M) or the Lenovo IdeaPad Y580 (Intel Core i7-3610QM, Nvidia GeForce
GTX 660M), as their GPUs are more powerful.


Gaming Performance
==================

Thanks to the Nvidia GeForce GT 630 GPU, the user can indulge in games at
medium/high settings. Most games will run fluidly at medium settings and
resolution. The same is true for high settings and a lower resolution of
1366x768 pixels.

A few demanding games, like Battlefield 3, can push the Envy dv6 to its limits.


Noise Emissions
===============

While idle, the Envy dv6 is primarily quiet. We measure noise emissions between
33.5 to 35.2 dB(A). If the Blu-ray drive is used, the emissions rise to 37.4 dB(A).

At full load (stress test - Prime95 and FurMark run simultaneously), the noise
emission rises to a distracting 42.7 dB(A). The HP model is still loud at medium
load (3D Mark 06 running) and emits 42.5 dB(A).

The Lenovo IdeaPad Y580 has similar noise levels as the Envy dv6.

The Asus N56VZ-S4044V is better than both as it is much quieter.


Verdict
========


Buyers of the HP Envy dv6-7202eg receive a powerful multimedia notebook packed
to the brim with modern technology.

This laptop can complete any task with ease and look good while doing it.
We especially like the high contrast Full HD display with great viewing angle
stability and matte surface. The packet will set you back around 1,199 Euros
(~$1570) - a high price, but there are alternatives.
The other available Envy dv6 models work with the same CPU and GPU but have to
cut corners in other areas. The cons of this notebook would be the high noise
emissions, which kick in at medium load, and high heat emissions at load.
