Introduction
============

A microcontroller (sometimes abbreviated ÂµC, uC or MCU) is a small 
computer on a single integrated circuit containing a processor core, 
memory, and programmable input/output peripherals. 

Program memory in the form of NOR flash or OTP ROM is also often included 
on chip, as well as a typically small amount of RAM. 

Microcontrollers are designed for embedded applications, in contrast to 
the microprocessors used in personal computers or other general purpose 
applications.
