Description
============



The NVIDIA GeForce GT 630M is a relatively fast middle-class graphics card for
laptops.

Currently, it can be based on three different chips with different specifications
and performance values.

The GF108 version (a renamed GT 540M) features 96 shaders while the GF106/GF116
version (a renamed GT 550M) features 144 shaders.

Furthermore, the newer 28nm Fermi-based GF117 variant will be available as well
with significantly reduced power consumption.

All models feature a 128 Bit memory interface for DDR3 graphics memory. As part
of the Fermi architecture, the cards support DirectX 11 and OpenGL 4.0.


Architecture
============

More details on the GF108 and GF106/116 architecture can be found on the
dedicated pages of the GeForce GT 435M and GeForce GT 555M.

Details on the GF117 can be found on the GeForce GT 620M page.


Performance
============

The performance of the 96 shader version should be exactly like the GeForce
GT 540M and the 144 shader version like the GeForce GT 555M (see both gaming
benchmark pages). Demanding games of 2010 should therefore run fluently in
medium to high details.

However, certain 2011 games like Anno 2070 or Skyrim may need reduced detail
settings for fluent framerates. The GF117 version can be clocked up to 800 MHz
and therefore performs similar to the average GT 555M. However, exact clock
rates differ between laptop models and manufacturers; the overall performance
is somewhere between a GT 540M and GT 555M.

Features
========

A novelty of the GF104, GF106 and GF108 chips is the support for Bitstream HD
Audio (Blu-Ray) via HDMI. Similar to the Radeon HD 5730, the GT 630M can transfer
Dolby True HD and DTS-HD bitstream without quality loss to a HiFi receiver.

The GT 630M offers PureVideo HD technology for video decoding using the GPU.
The integrated Video Processor 4 (VP4) supports feature set C and is able to
fully decode MPEG-1, MPEG-2, MPEG-4 Part 2 (MPEG-4 ASP - e.g., DivX or Xvid),
VC-1/WMV9, and H.264 (VLD, IDCT, Motion Compensation, and Deblocking).

Furthermore, the GPU is able to decode two 1080p streams simultaneously (e.g.,
for Blu-Ray Picture-in-Picture).

Through CUDA, OpenCL, and DirectCompute 2.1 support, the GeForce GT 630M can
assist in general calculations. For example, the stream processor can encode
videos considerably faster than can a modern CPU. Furthermore, physics
calculations can be done by the GPU using PhysX (supported in Mafia 2 and
Metro 2033).

However, the GPU is not powerful enough to support both PhysX and high detail
game settings at reasonable frame rates.

Following the current 3D trend, the 630M supports 3D Vision. This enables the
laptop to send 3D content (3D games, 3D Web Streaming, 3D photos, 3D Blu-Rays)
to a built-in 3D enabled screen or an external 3D TV if supported by the laptop
manufacturer. This feature is disabled if the notebook includes Optimus.

The power consumption of the GeForce GT 630M should be similar to the GeForce
GT 435M or Radeon HD 5730 and is therefore suited for 15" or larger laptops.
If idle or not under load, the chip is clocked at approximately 50/101/137 MHz
(chip/shader/memory, respectively) in 2D mode and at 202/405/324 MHz in 3D mode
to save power. Furthermore, the 600M series supports Optimus to automatically
switch between the integrated Intel graphics card and the Nvidia GPU.

The implementation of Optimus, however, is dependent on the laptop manufacturer.
