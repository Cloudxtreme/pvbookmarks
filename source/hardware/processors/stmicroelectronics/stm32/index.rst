Presentation
============

STM32 is a family of microcontroller ICs by STMicroelectronics. 

The STM32 chips are based on the 32-bit RISC ARM cores from ARM Holdings, 
such as:

- Cortex-M4F, 
- :ref:`Cortex-M3 <arm_cortex_m3>`, 
- Cortex-M0+, 
- and Cortex-M0 cores.

Documentation
==============

   - http://www.cs.indiana.edu/~geobrown/book.pdf

This book is intended as a hands-on manual for learning how to design 
systems using the STM32 F1 family of micro-controllers. 

It was written to support a junior-level computer science course at 
Indiana University. The focus of this book is on developing code to 
utilize the various peripherals available in STM32 F1 micro-controllers 
and in particular the STM32VL Discovery board. 

Because there are other fine sources of information on the Cortex-M3,
which is the core processor for the STM32 F1 micro-controllers, we do not
examine this core in detail; an excellent reference is â€œThe Definitive Guide to
the ARM CORTEX-M3".
