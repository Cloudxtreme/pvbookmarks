Introduction
============

The AT91SAM9XE flash-based microcontrollers are based on the ARM926ej-s 
cores. 

They have a top clock speed in the range of 200 MHz, and come with a 
variety of flash sizes. 
They somewhat resemble flash-equipped AT91SAM9260 chips.

Atmel introduced the AT91SAM9 processors (using the ARM926ej-s core, 
with the ARMv5TEJ architecture) as its first broad market follow on to 
the highly successful AT91rm9200 processor. 

These processors improved on that predecessor by using less power, 
incorporating a newer and more powerful ARM core, and providing a 
variety of chips with different peripheral sets. 

While most are clocked at up to about 200 MHz, some can run at twice 
that speed.
