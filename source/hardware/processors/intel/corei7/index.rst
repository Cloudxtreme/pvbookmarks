Description
============

Intel Core i7 is an Intel brand name for several families of desktop and laptop
64-bit x86-64 processors using the Nehalem, Westmere, Sandy Bridge and Ivy Bridge
microarchitectures.

The Core i7 brand is targeted at the business and high-end consumer markets for
both desktop and laptop computers, and is distinguished from the Core i3
(entry-level consumer), Core i5 (mainstream consumer), and Xeon (server and
workstation) brands.

The Intel Core i7-3630QM is a fast quad-core processor for laptops based on the
Ivy Bridge architecture and successor of the i7-??.

Due to Hyperthreading, the four cores can handle up to **eight threads** in parallel
leading to better utilization of the CPU.

Each core offers a base speed of 2.4 GHz but can dynamically increase clock rates
with Turbo Boost up to 3.2 GHz (for 4 active cores), 3.3 GHz (for 2 active cores)
and 3.4 GHz (for 1 active core).

Ivy Bridge is an enhanced die shrink of the Sandy Bridge architecture with
improvements on both GPU and CPU performance.

The CPUs are produced in 22nm (versus 32nm Sandy Bridge CPUs) and are the first
to introduce 3D transistors for increased energy efficiency when compared to
similarly clocked Sandy Bridge processors.

Other new features are integrated PCI Express 3.0 and  DDR3(L)-1600 support.

Except VT-d and vPro the 3630QM supports all functions of the Ivy Bridge core
like VT-x, AES or Trusted Execution.

The performance of the Core i7-3630QM should be slightly above a similarly
clocked Sandy Bridge processor due to slight architectural improvements.

As a result, overall performance should be above the former fastest model, the
Core i7-2920XM.

The integrated Intel HD Graphics 4000 offers 16 Execution Units (EUs) clocked at
650 MHz up to 1150 MHz with Turbo Boost, making it one of the faster variants.

As with most quad-core Ivy Bridge models, the Core i7-3630QM is specified at a
TDP of 45 Watts including graphics card and memory controller.

Therefore, the CPU is well-suited for laptops 15-inches or greater.
