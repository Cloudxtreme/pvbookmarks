Introduction
=============

As with all RISC processors, the Cortex-M3 is a load/store architecture 
with three basic types of instructions â€“ register-to-register operations 
for processing data, memory operations which move data between memory and
registers, and control flow operations enabling programming language control
flow such as if and while statements and procedure calls.
